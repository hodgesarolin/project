## Executive Summary

This document compiles expert predictions, scholarly analysis, and scenario planning for US politics from 2026-2030. It draws on assessments from political scientists, historians, think tanks, and international observers as of January 2026.

**Key Finding:** A survey of 500+ political scientists finds that the vast majority believe the United States has moved from liberal democracy toward some form of authoritarianism, specifically "competitive authoritarianism" similar to Hungary and Turkey.

## Part I: Expert Predictions

### Political Scientists

#### Steven Levitsky (Harvard) - Co-author of "How Democracies Die"

> "We've slid into some form of authoritarianism... It is certainly reversible, but we are no longer living in a liberal democracy."

> "U.S. democracy will likely break down during the Second Trump administration in the sense that it will cease to meet standard criteria for a liberal democracy - full adult suffrage, free and fair elections, and broad protection of civil liberties."

**Key Prediction:** The most likely outcome is "competitive authoritarianism" - regimes that constitutionally appear democratic but where systematic abuse of power tilts the playing field against opposition.

**On Recovery Potential:**
> "Republicans, for the first time in several years, are beginning to say no to Trump and to stand up to Trump. This is how authoritarian regimes die: they die because they split; they fragment internally."

---

#### David Pozen (Columbia Law School)

> "The depth and breadth of this administration's disregard for civil liberties, political pluralism, the separation of powers and legal constraints of all kinds mark it as an authoritarian regime."

**Source:** [NPR Political Scientists Survey](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5340753/trump-democracy-authoritarianism-competive-survey-political-scientist)

---

#### Timothy Snyder (Yale, now University of Toronto) - Author of "On Tyranny"

> "Trump is weak at home, and he can be stopped - so long as the domestic political logic of foreign intervention is recognized and turned against him."

> "Whether the transition to authoritarianism in the United States succeeds depends on us."

**On Historical Parallels:**
> "In certain ways, the autumn of 2025 in the United States has recalled the autumn of 1938 in Nazi Germany."

**Note:** Snyder left Yale in July 2025 for the University of Toronto, joining a pattern of experts on authoritarianism leaving the United States.

#### Joseph Fishkin (UCLA Law School)

**On the Supreme Court:**
> Fears that while lower courts will uphold legal norms, the Supreme Court will "bend over backwards" to bolster administration ambitions. Describes it as "the most conservative Court since the late 19th century."

**On Constitutional Questions:**
> "There are fundamental questions in the air, including whether the 14th Amendment defining birthright citizenship will still apply. Last year, we assumed it would; this year, we cannot be so sure."

### Historians

#### Allan Lichtman (Presidential Historian)

> "While it's not an absolute predictor, it is an indicator of momentum going into a presidential election. 2026 will mean a lot for 2028."

**Historical Pattern:** Significant midterm losses have historically preceded changes in White House control, as happened before Trump's 2016 victory and Biden's 2020 win.

**Source:** [How 2026 Sets the Stage for 2028](https://www.ms.now/news/2028-politics-preview-presidential-campaign-2026-midterms)

---

#### Douglas Brinkley (Historian)

> Notes that Trump is "the most ubiquitous president ever" who "plays to win the day, every day." Yet history remembers presidencies not by that measure, but rather by what outlasts them.

---

### Think Tank Analyses

#### Brennan Center for Justice

**Key Finding:** There will be fewer competitive districts in the 2026 midterm elections than at any time in the last 52 years.

**Warning:** For the first time ever, the federal government itself is waging a broad campaign to undermine elections.

#### Brookings Institution

**2026 Outlook:**
- Maine holds one of the most pivotal 2026 Senate races (Susan Collins seat)
- Victories in California, Pennsylvania, and Maine may point to a Democratic comeback
- Democrats need a net gain of 3 House seats to win majority

---

#### Carnegie Endowment for International Peace

**On Democratic Recovery:**
> "Incipient authoritarianism has been turned back in countries as diverse as Brazil, Poland, Sri Lanka, and Senegal."

**Key Lesson:** In almost every instance where authoritarian projects have been defeated, it has been through elections.

**Source:** [Carnegie - Democratic Recovery After Backsliding](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/04/democratic-recovery-after-significant-backsliding-emergent-lessons)

---

### International Observer Assessments

#### International IDEA - Global State of Democracy 2025

**Key Finding:** 2024 marked the ninth consecutive year in which more countries experienced democratic decline than improvement.

**US Assessment:** Some observers describe developments as a "presidential coup," warning the country lies at the "cusp of autocracy."

**Source:** [International IDEA](https://www.idea.int/publications/catalogue/global-state-of-democracy-2025-democracy-on-the-move)

---

#### V-Dem Institute (Varieties of Democracy)

**Classification:** The V-Dem Institute has classified the United States as an "electoral autocracy" since late 2025.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Democratic Backsliding in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding_in_the_United_States)

---

#### Freedom House

**Historical Trend:** US score declined from 94 (2010) to 83 (2020), with an accelerated 6-point loss during Trump's first term alone.

**2025 Report Declines:**
- FTC/FCC investigations implicating constitutionally protected speech
- Chilling effect on digital activism from crackdowns on noncitizens
- Foreign nationals detained for nonviolent activities

**Source:** [Freedom House - US Country Report 2025](https://freedomhouse.org/country/united-states/freedom-world/2025)

---

## Part II: 2026 Midterm Scenarios

### Current Congressional Math

**House:**
- Republicans: 218 seats
- Democrats: 213 seats (following death of Rep. Doug LaMalfa)
- Democrats need net gain of 3 to win majority
- Republicans can lose no more than 2 seats

**Senate:**
- Republicans: 53 seats
- Democrats: 45 seats
- 2 Independents caucusing with Democrats
- Democrats need net gain of 4 to win majority

---

### Historical Midterm Patterns

**Key Pattern:** The party out of the White House typically gains seats in midterm elections.

**Expert Assessment:** Democrats will likely be boosted by favorable national headwinds, as midterms usually provide fertile ground for the party out of the White House.

---

### Key 2026 Races

**Senate Battlegrounds:**
- **Georgia:** Sen. Jon Ossoff (D) - potentially vulnerable
- **Michigan:** Open seat after Sen. Gary Peters retirement
- **Maine:** Sen. Susan Collins (R) - state carried by Harris by ~7 points in 2024
- **Ohio:** Former Sen. Sherrod Brown challenging Sen. Jon Husted (appointed to Vance seat)
- **Potential Reaches:** Alaska, Iowa, Texas (if blue wave occurs)

**Notable Retirements (9 total as of January 2026):**
- Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) - longest-serving Senate party leader
- Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) - running for governor
- Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) - running for governor
- Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) - running for governor

---

### Redistricting Impacts

**Current Situation:**
- Largest coordinated attempt to redraw congressional districts between decennial censuses in modern history
- Began with Texas gerrymandering at Trump's behest
- Republican-led states followed: Missouri, North Carolina
- Democratic response: California, Virginia, Maryland

**Net Effect:**
- Republicans could be ahead by ~4 seats from redistricting
- Cook Political Report rates 40 House districts as toss-ups
- More than half (23) of competitive districts are in states where commissions/courts drew maps

**Gerrymandering Impact:**
- Brennan Center estimates gerrymandering gives Republicans ~16 seat advantage
- Under new Texas map, no seat's presidential vote would have been decided by single digits

**Legal Challenges:**
- November 2025: Federal court in El Paso ruled Texas maps were illegal racial gerrymander
- Supreme Court temporarily blocked the ruling
- Georgia and Louisiana maps still subject to litigation

## Part III: Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: Authoritarian Consolidation

#### What Full Consolidation Looks Like

Based on Hungary/Turkey models:
1. **Executive Aggrandizement:** Elected officials erode checks and balances without overt coup
2. **Institutional Capture:** Civil service, prosecutor's office, judiciary filled with loyalists
3. **Media Control:** Attacks on media, universities, and NGOs to blunt criticism
4. **Electoral Tilting:** Playing field systematically tilted in ruling party's favor

**Levitsky/Way Assessment:**
> "If the Republican Party were to retain control over all major branches of government after 2026, the prospects for entrenchment would increase. Further purges and weaponization of the bureaucracy, increased politicization of the courts and the military, and tighter control over the media and universities could follow."

---

#### Timeline and Steps (Based on Hungary/Turkey Precedents)

**Hungary Timeline:**
- 1998-2010: Fidesz builds power, wins supermajority
- 2010-2014: Constitution rewritten, media captured, civil society attacked
- 2014-2019: Classification shifts from democracy to hybrid regime
- 2019-present: V-Dem classifies as "electoral authoritarianism"

**Turkey Timeline:**
- 2002: AKP wins promising democratic reforms
- 2007: Rule becomes more divisive
- 2011: AKP becomes hegemonic
- 2016: Failed coup used to accelerate crackdown
- Present: Full competitive authoritarian system

---

#### Constitutional Workarounds for 2028

**The 22nd Amendment Problem:**
> "No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice"

**Proposed Workarounds:**

1. **Constitutional Amendment** (Least Likely)
   - Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) proposed amendment
   - Requires 2/3 vote of Congress + 38 states
   - Since 1992: 1,400+ amendments proposed, none passed

2. **Vice President Route** (Trump calls "too cute")
   - Theory: Trump runs as VP, Vance resigns
   - Problem: 12th Amendment bars those ineligible for President from VP

3. **Alternating Terms** (Theoretical)
   - Use 22nd/25th Amendment interplay
   - Trump and ally alternate power
   - Theoretical 16-year reign possible

**Trump's Statements:**
> "A lot of people want me to do it. I'm not joking."
> "If you read it, it's pretty clear. I'm not allowed to run. It's too bad."

**Expert Assessment:**
> Wayne Unger (Quinnipiac): "I would predict the Supreme Court to say nope, it's clear, two terms of four years each."

**Global Context:** ~1/3 of presidents globally who reached term limits attempted to stay; 67% of those attempts succeeded.

#### 2028 Succession Dynamics

**Current Prediction Markets:**
- JD Vance: 48% chance of GOP nomination
- New Hampshire primary poll: Vance 51%, Haley 9%, Gabbard 8%
- AtlasIntel poll: Vance 47%, Rubio 23%, DeSantis 13%
- Turning Point USA straw poll: Vance 84.2%

**Trump's Position:**
> Indicated nomination "could be Vance's to lose"
> Named Vance and Rubio as potential successors in May interview

**Vance's Strategy:**
> Plans to wait until after midterms, then "sit down with President Trump and talk about 2028"
> Biggest priority: Show loyalty to Trump above all else

---

### Scenario 2: Resistance and Gridlock

#### Democrats Win House 2026

**Immediate Impact:**
> "A Democratic House in 2027 would present a systemic shock to a Washington that has, under unified GOP control, offered almost no substantial resistance to Trump."

**If Republicans lost either chamber, the legislative phase of Trump's presidency would end, and oversight hearings would put his administration on the defensive.**

---

#### Investigations and Oversight

**Democratic Plans:**
- Trump's business practices
- Removal of agency watchdogs
- Qatari luxury jet ethics concerns
- Cryptocurrency sales to foreign investors

**Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA):**
> Predicts presidential corruption, including Trumps' cryptocurrency sales to foreign investors, would be "front and center"

**Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX):**
> Would "absolutely at least do an inquiry" if Democrats retake House

---

#### Impeachment Possibilities

**Trump's Warning:**
> "You got to win the midterms, because if we don't win the midterms, it's just going to be - I mean, they'll find a reason to impeach me. I'll get impeached."

**Historical Context:**
- First impeachment (2019): Ukraine pressure
- Second impeachment (2021): January 6

**Current Articles Filed:** H.Res.353 - 119th Congress: "Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors"

**Democratic Leadership Skepticism:**
> Many Democrats openly skeptical impeachment would be worth their time with Senate guaranteed to acquit

**Source:** [ABC News - Trump Impeachment Warning](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-warns-republicans-win-midterms-hell-impeached/story?id=128958317)

---

#### Stalemate Dynamics

**Likely Outcome if Democrats Win House:**
1. No major legislation passes
2. Continuous oversight hearings
3. Budget battles and shutdowns
4. Executive action becomes primary governance tool
5. Courts become main venue for policy battles

---

### Scenario 3: Crisis and Collapse

#### Economic Crisis Triggers

**Debt Ceiling Crisis:**
- Limit kicked back in January 2, 2026
- Emergency accounting tricks until summer
- Political standoff expected

**Fiscal Outlook:**
- CBO projects large deficits through 2035
- Debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 100%

---

#### Dollar/Debt Crisis Scenarios

**Deutsche Bank Black Swan List:**
- US-Japan sovereign debt crisis
- AI bubble bursting
- Aggressive Fed rate hikes

**Dollar Forecast:**
> "V-shaped year" expected: Dollar weakens in first half (99 to ~94), rebounds in second half due to government spending and tariffs.

**Key Risks:**
- 26% of major investors see AI crash as biggest 2026 risk
- $3 trillion AI spending may not generate sufficient profit
- China property sector remains unresolved

**Source:** [MarketPulse - Dollar Forecast](https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/2026-us-dollar-forecast-how-the-fed-government-spending-and-ai-will-drive-volatility/)

---

#### Military Overreach Consequences

**Current Situation:**
- National Guard deployed in Democratic-led cities
- Officially for crackdowns on protests, crime, homelessness, immigration
- Critics label as Posse Comitatus Act violations

**Legal Ruling:**
> September 2025: Judge Charles Breyer ruled deployments violated Posse Comitatus Act, rationale was "contrived"

**Pentagon Concerns:**
> Internal communications cited "far-reaching social, political and operational impacts" with "extremely high" risk to civilians, troops, and military reputation.

**Trump on Urban Training:**
> "I told Pete, we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military."

**Budget Proposal:** $1.5 trillion defense spending for FY2027 - record high by far

#### International Isolation Impacts

**Aid Cuts:**
- By 2026, global ODA projected to decline by $62 billion
- US accounts for $36 billion of that decline

**Europe's Response:**
> Europe faces challenge of rethinking international democracy agenda without the United States.

### Scenario 4: Fragmentation

#### Blue State Divergence

**California Resistance:**
- 100+ lawsuits during first Trump term
- 40+ lawsuits in first year of second term (~1/week since January 2025)
- Governor Newsom called special session to "Trump-proof" the state
- AG Rob Bonta leading legal pushback

**Multi-State Actions:**
- 5 Democratic states sued over child care funding freeze: CA, NY, CO, IL, MN
- 22 Democratic AGs sued over birthright citizenship order

**Key Conflict Areas:**
- Immigration enforcement
- AI regulation
- Birthright citizenship
- Climate policy
- Reproductive rights

---

#### Constitutional Crisis Potential

**State-Federal Confrontation Points:**
- California refusing to ban transgender athletes (sued by federal government)
- Undocumented resident in-state tuition laws
- Federal law enforcement mask prohibitions
- Sanctuary policies

---

#### "National Divorce" Discussions

**Public Support:**
- 23% of Americans support their state leaving the union
- 52% of Trump voters have endorsed secession ideas
- 40% of Biden voters have fantasized about national divorce

**Active Movements:**
- New Hampshire Independence Movement (NHEXIT)
- Texas Nationalist Movement
- Yes California
- Post-2024 drives in New York

**Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA):**
> "We need a national divorce. We need to separate by red states and blue states and shrink the federal government."

**Source:** [Governing - What Would National Divorce Look Like](https://www.governing.com/context/what-would-a-national-divorce-look-like)

---

#### What Partial Dissolution Looks Like

**Expert Assessment (Ryan Griffiths, Syracuse):**
> "Red and Blue America are not neatly sorted and geographically concentrated. Splitting the two parts would require a dangerous unmixing of the population, one that could spiral into violence and state collapse."

**Legal Barrier:**
- Texas v. White (1869): Unilateral secession is unconstitutional

**Historical Warning:**
- ~50% of secessionist efforts globally end in violence
- Secessionism is one of chief causes of war internationally

**Catalonia Precedent:**
- Support for independence increased from 14% (2006) to 45% (2014)
- Demonstrates how quickly opinion can shift

**Source:** [Syracuse University - Secession](https://news.syr.edu/2025/10/02/secession-in-the-us-could-it-happen/)

---

### Scenario 5: Reform and Recovery

#### What Would Have to Happen

Based on Brazil/Poland examples:

1. **United Opposition Coalition**
   - Forge coalition across factional and ideological divides
   - Offer concrete policy ideas to improve lives
   - Narrative about justice and democracy

2. **Electoral Victory**
   - Flood zone with election workers and observers
   - Wage effective campaign
   - Seize electoral opportunity

3. **Civil Society Mobilization**
   - Coordinated resistance (Brazil: 900,000+ signed "Letter to Brazilians in Defense of Democratic Rule of Law")
   - Community leaders speak out publicly
   - Cross-partisan endorsements

4. **Post-Victory Institutional Restoration**
   - Remove illiberal military leaders (Brazil example)
   - Transition agencies away from military control
   - Restore media freedom (Poland priority)

**Source:** [Carnegie - Democratic Recovery](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/04/democratic-recovery-after-significant-backsliding-emergent-lessons)

---

#### Historical Examples of Democratic Recovery

**Brazil (2022):**
- Lula defeated backsliding incumbent Bolsonaro
- Key factor: Coordinated civil society resistance
- Influential leaders endorsed Lula across political spectrum
- Post-victory: Fired illiberal military leaders, dismissed military from administration

**Poland (2023):**
- After 8 years of Law and Justice Party (PiS)
- Tusk coalition gained enough seats for correction
- Rare reversal in environment where democratic erosion typically only goes one direction
- Early focus: Restoring media freedom

**Other Examples:**
- Sri Lanka
- Senegal
- Botswana (recent)
- Mauritius (recent)

**Source:** [Our World in Data - Four Countries That Reversed Decline](https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/four-countries-that-have-successfully-reversed-democratic-decline-in-recent-years)

---

#### Required Conditions

**Levitsky/Way on US Advantages:**
> "Opposition forces in the United States are well-organized, well-financed, and electorally viable, which makes them harder to co-opt, repress, and defeat at the polls. American opposition will therefore be harder to sideline than it was in countries such as El Salvador, Hungary, and Turkey."

**Poland's Strengths (Model for US):**
- Extremely active and independent civil society
- Courts under pressure but not collapsed entirely
- Electoral integrity remains intact
- 2023 election demonstrated stable elections

---

#### Likelihood Assessment

**Levitsky:**
> "This is authoritarianism on the one hand, but it's an authoritarianism that can be reversed - and I think likely will be reversed."

**Levitsky/Way Medium-Term Prediction:**
> "The most likely medium-term outcome in the United States is neither entrenched authoritarianism nor a return to stable democracy. Rather, it is regime instability: a protracted struggle between authoritarian impulses and democratic solidarity."

**Limiting Factor on Consolidation:**
> "Elected autocrats are far more successful in consolidating power when they enjoy broad public support... Trump's approval rating is stuck in the low 40s."

**Comparison:** Bukele (El Salvador), Chavez (Venezuela), Fujimori (Peru), Putin (Russia) all had 80%+ approval when imposing authoritarian rule.

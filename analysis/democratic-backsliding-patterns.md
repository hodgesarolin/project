## The Four Warning Signs (Levitsky & Ziblatt)

### Source
Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, *How Democracies Die* (2018) - Harvard political scientists who developed a "litmus test" to identify authoritarians before they come to power.

### The Four Indicators

> "Levitsky and Ziblatt identify four facets of authoritarian behavior: 1) rejection of (or weak commitment to) democratic rules of the game; 2) denial of legitimacy to political opponents; 3) toleration or encouragement of violence; and 4) readiness to curtail civil liberties of opponents, including the media."
>
> Source: [Wikipedia - How Democracies Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Democracies_Die)

#### 1. Rejection of Democratic Rules
- Weak commitment to constitutional rules
- Willingness to violate or circumvent norms
- Questioning legitimacy of elections

#### 2. Denial of Legitimacy to Opponents
- Describing rivals as existential threats
- Labeling opponents as criminals or subversives
- Claiming opponents are foreign agents
- Treating opposition as illegitimate

#### 3. Toleration or Encouragement of Violence
- Ties to armed gangs or paramilitary groups
- Refusing to condemn violence by supporters
- Endorsing or failing to punish political violence

#### 4. Readiness to Curtail Civil Liberties
- Threatening to restrict media freedom
- Threatening to punish critics
- Supporting restrictions on civil society
- Praising repressive measures in other countries

### The Soft Guardrails

Levitsky and Ziblatt emphasize two critical democratic norms:

#### Mutual Toleration
> "Mutual toleration refers to the idea 'that as long as rivals play by constitutional rules, they accept that the other has an equal right to exist, compete for power and govern.' Without this, rivals become enemies, disputes become zero sum, and elections become extremely high stakes."
>
> Source: [Wikipedia - How Democracies Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Democracies_Die)

#### Institutional Forbearance
> "Forbearance means refraining from exercising one's legal right. It is an act of deliberate self-restraintâan underutilization of power that is legally available to us."
>
> Source: [LitCharts Analysis](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/how-democracies-die/terms/institutional-forbearance)

### Key Quote on Modern Democratic Death

> "Democracy no longer ends with a bangâin a revolution or military coupâbut with a whimper: the slow, steady weakening of critical institutions, such as the judiciary and the press, and the gradual erosion of long-standing political norms."
>
> Source: [European Council Library](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/library/library-blog/posts/how-democracies-die-what-history-reveals-about-our-future/)

> "The tragic paradox of the electoral route to authoritarianism is that democracy's assassins use the very institutions of democracyâgradually, subtly, and even legallyâto kill it."

## The Twenty Lessons (Timothy Snyder)

### Source
Timothy Snyder, *On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century* (2017) - Yale historian and expert on Eastern Europe and the Holocaust.

> "History does not repeat, but it does instruct."
> â Timothy Snyder, opening line

### The 20 Lessons

1. **Do not obey in advance.** Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked.

2. **Defend institutions.** It is institutions that help us to preserve decency. They need our help as well. Do not speak of "our institutions" unless you make them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions do not protect themselves.

3. **Beware the one-party state.** The parties that remade states and suppressed rivals were not combating some system. They were becoming the system.

4. **Take responsibility for the face of the world.** Notice the symbols and signs around you. Remove hate symbols when you see them.

5. **Remember professional ethics.** When political leaders set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become more important.

6. **Be wary of paramilitaries.** When men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching with torches, the end is nigh.

7. **Be reflective if you must be armed.** If you carry a weapon in public service, be ready to say no to orders that violate the Constitution.

8. **Stand out.** Someone has to. It is easy to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different.

9. **Be kind to our language.** Avoid repeating the phrases used by leaders. Make your own speech.

10. **Believe in truth.** To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power.

11. **Investigate.** Figure things out for yourself. Research everything.

12. **Make eye contact and small talk.** This is not just polite. It is part of being a citizen and maintaining social connections.

13. **Practice corporeal politics.** Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people.

14. **Establish a private life.** Tyrants seek to know everything about everyone. Protect your communications.

15. **Contribute to good causes.** Active participation in civil society organizations bolsters democracy.

16. **Learn from peers in other countries.** Americans are not the only people facing these problems. Make friends abroad.

17. **Listen for dangerous words.** Be alert to terms like "extremism" and "terrorism" when used to justify restricting freedoms.

18. **Be calm when the unthinkable arrives.** Modern tyranny is terror management. Do not let fear dominate your thinking.

19. **Be a patriot.** Set a good example of what America means for future generations.

20. **Be as courageous as you can.** If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die under tyranny.

### Key Theme

> "The Founding Fathers tried to protect us from the threat they knew, the tyranny that overcame ancient democracy. Today, our political order faces new threats, not unlike the totalitarianism of the twentieth century. We are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience."

## Strongmen Patterns (Ruth Ben-Ghiat)

### Source
Ruth Ben-Ghiat, *Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present* (2020) - NYU professor of history and Italian studies.

### Defining Features of Authoritarian Leaders

> "Ben-Ghiat identifies the defining features of authoritarianism for the last hundred years: the arrogation of power by an individual ruler who creates a personality cult for themselves; control over information and public discourse; use of violence and repression, both to eliminate known adversaries and serve as a deterrent; and the cultivation of nationalism, in which adversaries are opposed through a process of 'othering.'"
>
> Source: [W.W. Norton](https://wwnorton.com/books/strongmen)

### Personality Traits

> "They each have their own quirks and are not exactly the same, but they all have paranoia, narcissism, they are all very aggressive, and they like to humiliate others. This leads to certain styles of governance that are very dysfunctional and full of turmoil."
>
> "They create inner sanctums around themselves with family members because they're corrupt and need people to keep their secrets. But everybody else is humiliated and fired and re-hired. So their governments are not stable at all. Their personalities are impulsive and they think they are infallible."
>
> Source: [ECPS Interview](https://www.populismstudies.org/professor-ben-ghiat-any-society-can-be-susceptible-to-strongman-figures-if-its-the-right-time/)

### Three Eras of Strongman Rule

Ben-Ghiat traces strongmen across three successive eras:

1. **Fascist Takeovers (1919-1945)**
   - Hitler, Mussolini, Franco
   - Direct seizure of power

2. **Military Coups (1950-1990)**
   - Gaddafi, Pinochet, Mobutu
   - Armed forces overthrow governments

3. **Electoral Authoritarianism (1990-present)**
   - Berlusconi, Erdogan, Putin, Trump
   - Elected leaders who subvert democracy from within

### Gender Politics of Strongmen

Ben-Ghiat identifies three core elements:

1. **Institutionalized misogyny** - keeping women subordinate through natalist policies
2. **Personal machismo** - hyper-masculine displays (e.g., Putin's shirtless photos)
3. **Mobilized homophobia** - opposition to LGBTQ causes as a form of othering

### When Strongmen Rise

> "Strongmen find favor at moments of uncertainty and high anxiety, 'when the usual system of political representation no longer yields results or inspires public enthusiasm.' Economic shocks, in the form of depressions or recessions, increase openness to untested alternatives."
>
> Source: [W.W. Norton](https://wwnorton.com/books/strongmen)

### On Failure

> "Strongmen are reluctant to learn from defeat, nor do they develop successors: 'The authoritarian playbook has no chapter on failure.'"
>
> Source: [ECPS Interview](https://www.populismstudies.org/professor-ben-ghiat-any-society-can-be-susceptible-to-strongman-figures-if-its-the-right-time/)

## Democracy Measurement Frameworks

### Freedom House: Freedom in the World

**Methodology:**
- 100-point scale based on 25 indicators
- Categories: Political Rights (40 points) and Civil Liberties (60 points)
- Classifications: "Free," "Partly Free," or "Not Free"
- 210 countries and territories assessed annually

**2025 Key Findings:**

> "In their annual Freedom in the World report, Freedom House announced a global decline in freedom scores for the 19th consecutive year."
>
> Source: [Democracy Without Borders](https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/35074/freedom-house-reports-global-freedom-decline-for-19th-consecutive-year/)

- Political rights and civil liberties deteriorated in 60 countries
- Only 34 countries reported improvements
- 106 out of 195 countries rated as "electoral democracies" (down from 110)
- 40% of 2024 elections experienced voting-related violence

### V-Dem Institute: Varieties of Democracy

**Methodology:**
- Based at University of Gothenburg
- Uses multiple indices: Liberal Democracy, Electoral Democracy, etc.
- Over 450 indicators across multiple dimensions
- Annual Democracy Reports since 2017

**2025 Key Findings:**

> "The number of autocracies has risen from 88 to 91 (56 electoral and 35 closed autocracies) and has surpassed the number of democracies, which has fallen from 91 to 88 countries."
>
> Source: [V-Dem Democracy Report 2025](https://www.v-dem.net/documents/60/V-dem-dr__2025_lowres.pdf)

- Liberal democracies: only 29 countries (least common regime type)
- 72% of world population living under autocracies
- Average democracy level back to 1985 levels
- 45 countries currently autocratizing (up from 12 twenty years ago)
- Only 19 countries democratizing (6% of world population)

### The Economist Democracy Index

**Methodology:**
- 60 indicators across 5 categories
- Categories: Electoral process, Functioning of government, Political participation, Political culture, Civil liberties
- Scale: 0-10
- Classifications: Full Democracy (8-10), Flawed Democracy (6-8), Hybrid Regime (4-6), Authoritarian (<4)

**US Classification:**
- Downgraded from "Full Democracy" to "Flawed Democracy" in 2016
- Score dropped from 8.05 (2015) to 7.98 (2016)
- Continued decline through 2021

### Polity Data Series

**Current US Status:**
> "The Polity data series classified the United States as an 'anocracy' after the attempted self-coup by Trump in the January 6 United States Capitol attack in early 2021; in 2024 and 2025, it was further downgraded and described as 'no longer... a democracy' and lying 'at the cusp of autocracy.'"
>
> Source: [Wikipedia - Democratic backsliding in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding_in_the_United_States)

### Bright Line Watch

- Classifies US as a "mixed regime"
- Ranks US between Israel (49) and Mexico (60)
- Well below Great Britain (83) and Canada (88)
- Largest partisan gap in democracy ratings since data collection began in 2017

## Varieties of Authoritarianism

### Regime Type Classifications

| Regime Type | Definition | Examples |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Full Autocracy** | No meaningful political competition | North Korea, Saudi Arabia |
| **Electoral Autocracy** | Elections held but heavily manipulated | Russia, Venezuela |
| **Competitive Authoritarianism** | Real competition exists but playing field is unfair | Hungary, Turkey |
| **Hybrid Regime** | Mix of democratic and autocratic elements | Various transitional states |
| **Flawed Democracy** | Democratic institutions but significant weaknesses | United States, India |
| **Full Democracy** | Robust democratic institutions and norms | Norway, Denmark |

### Competitive Authoritarianism (Levitsky & Way)

> "Competitive authoritarianismâin which the coexistence of meaningful democratic institutions and serious incumbent abuse yields electoral competition that is real but unfairâis alive and well."
>
> Source: [Journal of Democracy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-new-competitive-authoritarianism/)

**Key Features:**
- Elections occur but are not free and fair
- Opposition parties exist but face systematic disadvantages
- Some media freedom exists but is constrained
- Judiciary may retain some independence but is pressured

**Three Instruments of Control:**
1. Self-serving use of state institutions (voter intimidation, electoral fraud)
2. Overuse of state resources for political advantage
3. Disruption of civil liberties (press freedom, association)

### Electoral Authoritarianism

> "Electoral authoritarianism means that democratic institutions are imitative and, due to numerous systematic violations of liberal democratic norms, in fact adhere to authoritarian methods."
>
> Source: [Wikipedia - Hybrid regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_regime)

- Two-thirds of elections in authoritarian systems allow some opposition
- Elections structured to heavily favor incumbents
- Almost half of authoritarian systems have multi-party governments (2020)

## Stages of Democratic Decline

### V-Dem's Pattern of Autocratization

> "Most autocracies develop in a predictable mannerâbeginning with restrictions on media, academic freedom and civil society. Then governments promote polarization among their own citizens with disinformation campaigns via social media before moving on to disrespect and intolerance for opposing political views."
>
> Source: [V-Dem Democracy Report 2025](https://www.v-dem.net/documents/60/V-dem-dr__2025_lowres.pdf)

**Typical Sequence:**
1. **Freedom of Expression Attacked First**
   - Media censorship
   - Restrictions on academic freedom
   - Attacks on civil society

2. **Disinformation and Polarization**
   - Social media manipulation
   - Spreading of false narratives
   - Division of citizenry

3. **Executive Aggrandizement**
   - Dismantling institutional checks
   - Weakening courts and legislature
   - Expanding executive power

### Levitsky & Ziblatt's Three-Stage Model

> "Democratic erosion typically has three stages: First an 'elected autocrat' will start 'capturing the referees' by changing personnel in courts, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies. Then, with loyalists wielding government powers, autocrats sideline opposition figures. Finally, autocrats 'change the playing field' of electoral politics through new rules about gerrymandering, campaign finance, and media access."
>
> Source: [Harvard Ash Center](https://ash.harvard.edu/articles/the-democratic-dismantling-of-democracies-how-leaders-undermine-the-systems-that-elect-them/)

**Stage 1: Capturing the Referees**
- Replacing judges with loyalists
- Politicizing law enforcement
- Taking control of intelligence agencies
- Packing election commissions

**Stage 2: Sidelining Opponents**
- Investigating/prosecuting opposition
- Restricting opposition media
- Intimidating critics
- Co-opting or marginalizing civil society

**Stage 3: Tilting the Playing Field**
- Gerrymandering
- Changing campaign finance rules
- Restricting voting access
- Manipulating media landscape

### Thailand's Four-Stage Model

> "In Thailand, democracy was dismantled in four stages: first, rewriting the constitution; second, dismantling the opposition; third, weakening institutions; and fourth, suppressing voters."
>
> Source: [Harvard Law School](https://hls.harvard.edu/today/when-democracies-backslide/)

### Point of Reversibility

**When Can Backsliding Be Stopped?**

> "Acting in early stages of autocratization seems critical â within one electoral cycle (4-6 years) after the onset."
>
> Source: [V-Dem Democracy Report 2025](https://www.v-dem.net/documents/60/V-dem-dr__2025_lowres.pdf)

> "If autocratization is underway, democracies can still be resilient to breakdown. Such cases are rare â 11% from 1900 to 2023 â but most happened during the last 30 years."
>
> Source: [V-Dem](https://v-dem.net/media/publications/wp_147_yvOYnKU.pdf)

**Factors That Enable Recovery:**
- Strong civil society that can inform citizens
- Opposition ability to form coalitions
- Judicial independence preserved
- Media freedom maintained
- Electoral integrity protected

**Warning from Scholars:**

> "You don't realize you're in a period of democratic backsliding until it's too late."
> â Carlos Guevara, Venezuelan politician

## Historical Case Studies

### Democracies That Failed to Recover

#### Weimar Germany (1919-1933)

**Timeline:** 14 years from establishment to collapse

**Key Factors:**
> "Conservative groups that were actively hostile to democracy remained deeply entrenched in the German power structure, even after the Revolution of 1918/19. Social Democrats tolerated them in the pursuit of stability, but the presence of anti-democratic elements throughout the ministries, and especially their dominance within the military and other security services, ultimately proved catastrophic."
>
> Source: [Tobin Project](https://tobinproject.org/sites/default/files/assets/Chapter%201%20-%20Introduction%20-%20Moss,%20Fung,%20&%20Westad.pdf)

**Contributing Factors:**
- Article 48 emergency decree powers
- Economic crisis (hyperinflation, Depression)
- Anti-democratic elites in military, judiciary, civil service
- Polarization between left and right
- Stab-in-the-back myth delegitimizing democracy

**Lesson:**
> "When authoritarians come to power, they come into office not on their own, but with the enabling aid of political allies from inside the political establishment."
>
> Source: [Harvard Ash Center](https://ash.harvard.edu/articles/the-democratic-dismantling-of-democracies-how-leaders-undermine-the-systems-that-elect-them/)

#### Venezuela (1998-2017)

**Timeline:** ~20 years from Chavez election to full autocracy

> "In Venezuela, Hugo Chavez was a political outsider who railed against what he cast as a corrupt governing elite, promising to build a more 'authentic' democracy... The chavista regime grew more repressive after 2006, closing a major television station, arresting or exiling opposition politicians, judges, and media figures on dubious charges, and eliminating presidential term limits."
>
> Source: [Harvard Ash Center](https://ash.harvard.edu/articles/the-democratic-dismantling-of-democracies-how-leaders-undermine-the-systems-that-elect-them/)

**Stages:**
- 1998: Chavez elected on anti-corruption platform
- 1999: New constitution, expanded executive power
- 2006: Closed major TV station, attacked opposition
- 2009: Eliminated term limits
- 2017: Constituent assembly usurped Congress powers

#### Hungary (2010-present)

**Timeline:** Rapid transformation within one electoral term

> "In the Hungarian parliamentary elections of 2010, the alliance of Fidesz and the KDNP won a majority of votes and a two-thirds majority of seats. The new prime minister Viktor Orban pursued drastic changes: 'Never in the history of the European Union has an election in a member state resulted in political, legal, economic and administrative changes of this magnitude in such a short period.'"
>
> Source: [V-Dem](https://v-dem.net/weekly_graph/autocratization-in-hungary-and-turkey)

**Key Actions:**
- Rewrote constitution
- Packed Constitutional Court
- Took control of media
- Gerrymandered electoral districts
- Restricted civil society

**Current Status:** Classified as "competitive authoritarian" or "electoral autocracy"

### Democracies That Recovered

#### Poland (2015-2023)

**Backsliding Period:** 8 years under Law and Justice (PiS)

**Recovery:**
> "In the parliamentary election in October 2023, PiS and its United Right alliance lost a significant level of support. The Civic Coalition was able to form a government with the support of two other alliances under Donald Tusk on December 11, 2023."
>
> Source: [International IDEA](https://www.idea.int/blog/polands-democratic-backsliding-over-history-shows-it-takes-more-election)

**Factors in Recovery:**
- Civil society remained active and informed
- Opposition united despite differences
- Judicial resistance to some changes
- EU pressure and oversight
- Electoral integrity maintained enough for turnover

#### Brazil (2019-2022)

> "Brazil's experience with democratic resilience in the face of Bolsonaro's authoritarian tendencies provides valuable insights. The instrumental role of institutional safeguardsâparticularly the STF (Supreme Federal Tribunal) and TSE (Superior Electoral Court)âdemonstrates that robust judicial independence can be a critical bulwark against democratic backsliding."
>
> Source: [RevDem](https://revdem.ceu.edu/2025/05/23/brazils-democratic-resilience/)

**Factors in Recovery:**
- Supreme Court actively resisted overreach
- Electoral courts protected election integrity
- Civil society mobilization
- Bolsonaro's narrow defeat in 2022
- Legal accountability pursued post-transition

### Velocity of Democratic Decline

**How Fast Can It Happen?**

| Country | Time to Autocratization | Classification |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|
| Hungary | ~4-6 years | Electoral Autocracy by ~2014-2016 |
| Turkey | ~10 years | Electoral Autocracy by 2013 |
| Venezuela | ~20 years | Full recognition as autocracy 2017 |
| Poland | Halted at ~8 years | Began recovery 2023 |

> "From 2009 to 2018, Hungary experienced particularly large declines in its liberal democracy index score (-0.28), the most significant drop in the EU10 group."

## Current US Assessment

### Democracy Index Ratings (2025)

| Index | Current Rating | Change |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Freedom House | 83/100 | -11 points since 2010 |
| V-Dem | Electoral Autocracy (late 2025) | Reclassified |
| Polity | "Cusp of autocracy" | Downgraded |
| EIU Democracy Index | Flawed Democracy | Since 2016 |
| CIVICUS | "Obstructed" (56/100) | -6 points in 2025 |
| Protect Democracy | 3.4/5 "Severe Threat" | Ongoing |

### Freedom House Assessment

> "Over the last 13 years, the United States has fallen by 11 points in their 100-point Freedom in the World index, now placing far behind long-standing democratic nations that had previously been peers."
>
> Source: [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/country/united-states/freedom-world/2025)

> "According to Harvard professor Steven Levitsky, the U.S. slipped from the low 90s to 83, placing it below Argentina and in a tie with Romania and Panama. This puts the U.S. still above what scholars would consider a democracy, but now in the 'very low-quality democracy range.'"

### Pattern of US Autocratization

> "The logic of Trump's actions follows the script: removing checks on the executive power by expanding control over independent agencies, dismantling congressional and judicial oversight (horizontal accountability), weakening civil society and independent media oversight (diagonal accountability), and undermining citizens' capacity to hold the government accountable (vertical accountability)."
>
> Source: [V-Dem](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510347.2025.2487825)

### Institutional Status (2025)

#### Compromised or Under Attack

**Executive Power:**
- Massive expansion under unitary executive theory
- Multiple actions violating federal laws/Constitution
- DOGE dismantling agency capacities

**Civil Service:**
- Mass reassignments and dismissals
- Targeting of career professionals
- Loyalty tests for appointees

**Judiciary:**
> "Since the new administration took office on January 20, 2025, a significant number of lawyers, prosecutors and immigration judges have been reassigned, transferred or dismissed without following standard procedures."
>
> Source: [UN OHCHR](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/03/united-states-new-administration-must-halt-sweeping-attacks-independent)

**Media:**
- Targeting outlets that refuse to praise President
- Associated Press barred from Oval Office
- Threats to broadcast licenses
- Journalists labeled "enemies of the people"

**Civil Society:**
> "Trump has extracted more than $1.2 billion in settlements in a 'cultural crackdown' against a variety of institutions."
>
> Source: [Wikipedia - Democratic backsliding in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding_in_the_United_States)

#### Remaining Potential Guardrails

**Federal Courts (partial):**
- Biden appointees in lower courts
- Some judges issuing rulings against administration
- But impeachment threats against ruling judges

**State-Level Democracy:**
- Some states maintaining democratic norms
- State courts providing checks
- Variable by state political control

**Civil Society:**
- Legal organizations filing challenges
- Journalism continuing despite pressure
- Civic organizations mobilizing

### Expert Assessments

> "Many argue that Trump's actions since January 2025 strongly resemble those by leaders of other countries where democracy has been significantly eroded, that Trump is operating from the same 'autocratic playbook' that elected leaders in many other countries have utilized to dismantle democracy."

### Factors for Potential Resistance

> "Despite blatant warning signs, there are some reasons to temper the alarmism surrounding the prospects of democratic backsliding in the United States. President Trump is not overwhelmingly popular, and aspects of his agenda will unlikely garner support from most of the electorate. Furthermore, whether his legacy will endure following the end of his presidency is unclear."

## Role of Key Institutions

### Courts and Judiciary

**Potential Protective Role:**
> "In a time of democratic backsliding, a robust protection of rights by an independent and assertive judiciary is seen as essential to preserving liberal constitutional democracy."

**But Also Potential Facilitator:**
> "Under some conditions, courts can and have performed a protective role successfully. Under other conditions, courts have instead turned a blind eye to democratic backsliding or have even contributed to the process themselves."
>

**How Courts Are Captured:**
> "The process of capturing the judiciary usually unfolds in three interactive steps: a) public threats or attacks on the judiciary; b) judicial purges; and/or c) packing of the courts."

### Independent Media

**Critical Role:**
- Informing citizens about threats to democracy
- Investigating government overreach
- Providing alternative information sources

**How Undermined:**
> "The backslider can significantly impair the ability of these non-government 'institutions' to act as a check by buying up, shutting down or regulating the media; placing onerous requirements on unfriendly civil society organizations; and using libel laws or states of emergency to restrict freedoms."
>

### Opposition Parties

> "Opposition parties are particularly important to resisting autocratic incumbents, the researchers determined, and must set aside policy differences to unify around the goal of defending democracy."
>
> Source: [Cornell Chronicle](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2024/01/democratic-decline-global-phenomenon-even-wealthy-nations)

### Civil Society

**Key for Recovery:**
> "Two critical common factors enabled citizens to reject backsliding leaders: the resilience of civil society and its ability to inform citizens about damage being done to their democracy, and the ability of political opposition to pursue smart tactics like forging coalitions and broadening their appeal beyond traditional supporters."

## Key Quotes from Scholars

### On the Nature of Modern Democratic Death

> "Democracies do not die the way they used to die. Democracies used to die at the hands of men with guns. Today democracies die in a much more subtle way. They die at the hands not of generals, but of elected leaders, presidents, prime ministers who use the very institutions of democracy to subvert it."
> â Steven Levitsky
>
> Source: [American Academy in Berlin](https://www.americanacademy.de/how-democracies-die/)

### On Early Warning

> "It's very important to see the warning signs in the beginning and stop these people in their tracks."
> â Ruth Ben-Ghiat
>
> Source: [ECPS](https://www.populismstudies.org/professor-ben-ghiat-any-society-can-be-susceptible-to-strongman-figures-if-its-the-right-time/)

### On the Importance of Timing

> "If you can identify threats to democracy and respond to them in the early stages, you're much more likely to be able to resist backsliding."
> â Rachel Riedl, Cornell
>
> Source: [Cornell Chronicle](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2024/01/democratic-decline-global-phenomenon-even-wealthy-nations)

### On Reversibility

> "The grossest of democratic backsliding is not irreversible, and that things can be put back on a positive track."
> â Marko Bosnjak, European Court of Human Rights
>
> Source: [IFES](https://www.ifes.org/pub/paths-democratic-resilience-era-backsliding/understanding-democratic-backsliding)

### On Historical Lessons

> "We are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience."
> â Timothy Snyder

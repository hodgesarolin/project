# Authoritarian & Dictator Regimes Research

Comprehensive research into authoritarian regimes, dictatorships, and absolute monarchies from 1000 CE to present.

## Scope

### Included
- **Personal dictatorships** — single ruler with unchecked power
- **Military juntas** — military rule by decree
- **Single-party states** — communist, fascist, or other one-party systems
- **Absolute monarchies** — monarchs ruling without meaningful checks
- **Theocracies** — religious authority as political authority
- **Hybrid regimes** — nominally democratic but functionally authoritarian

### Treatment
- **Monarchies**: Summary format covering dynasty patterns, notable rulers, treatment of subjects, how they rose/fell
- **Individual regimes**: Deep individual files with full sourcing

## Research Methodology

### Source Hierarchy
1. **Primary sources** — contemporary documents, speeches, laws
2. **Academic sources** — peer-reviewed history, political science
3. **Reputable secondary** — established historians, encyclopedias
4. **Multiple perspectives** — not just "winners'" history

### Controversial Classifications
When historians disagree:
- Note the debate explicitly
- Present multiple scholarly viewpoints
- Cite who says what and why
- Avoid declaring definitive answers where genuine disagreement exists

### Fact Standards
- Every claim must have at least one credible source
- Death tolls noted as ranges when disputed
- Distinguish established fact from scholarly interpretation
- Note confidence levels

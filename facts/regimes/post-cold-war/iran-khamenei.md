# Ali Khamenei's Iran (1989-Present)

## Overview

Seyyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei (born April 19, 1939) has served as the second Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran since June 4, 1989, following the death of revolutionary founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. His 36-year tenure makes him the longest-serving head of state in the Middle East and the longest-serving Iranian leader since Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

## 1. Pre-Conditions: The Legacy of Revolution and War

### The 1979 Islamic Revolution

The Iranian Revolution culminated in February 1979 with the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty and the establishment of the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The revolution was fueled by widespread discontent with the Shah's autocratic regime, characterized by economic mismanagement, corruption, and Western cultural influence.

**Key Revolutionary Changes:**
- February 1, 1979: Khomeini returned to Iran after exile, greeted by millions
- February 11, 1979: Monarchy officially fell
- March 1979: Referendum approved Islamic Republic with 98% support
- December 1979: Khomeini emerged as Supreme Leader

### The Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988)

The eight-year war with Iraq, initiated by Saddam Hussein on September 22, 1980, paradoxically strengthened the revolutionary regime:

- **Casualties**: Approximately one million combined Iraqi and Iranian soldiers killed, plus equivalent civilian deaths
- **Economic Cost**: Exceeded $1 trillion
- **Political Effect**: The war and the American hostage crisis increased support for the Islamic Republic, allowing Khomeini to eliminate domestic opposition
- **Regional Impact**: Fundamentally worsened Iran's relations with Arab Gulf states who supported Saddam

### Khomeini's Death (June 3, 1989)

Ayatollah Khomeini died on the night of June 3, 1989. Millions took to the streets in mourning, and the country faced a succession crisis. The originally designated successor, Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri, had been effectively dismissed three months earlier for criticizing the regime's brutal excesses and questioning Khomeini's interpretation of velayat-e faqih.

## 2. Rise to Power: The 1989 Selection

### Constitutional Crisis

The original Iranian constitution required the Supreme Leader to be a *marja-e taqlid* (source of emulation) - the highest-ranking religious authority in Twelver Shia Islam. Khamenei, while a cleric, had never achieved this status. He was a mid-ranking cleric without the theological credentials traditionally required.

### Constitutional Amendment

In April 1989, Khomeini established a Council for the Revision of the Constitution. Crucially, Khomeini stated:

> "From the very beginning, I believed and insisted that there is no need for the requirements of marja'iyyat. A pious mujtahid (jurist-intellectual), who is approved by the esteemed Assembly of Experts, will suffice."

This doctrinal shift separated religious scholarly authority from political leadership.

> Source: [1989 Iranian Supreme Leader election - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Iranian_Supreme_Leader_election)

### The Assembly of Experts Vote

On June 4, 1989, the day after Khomeini's death, the Assembly of Experts elected Khamenei:

- **Initial Vote**: 45 members voted for a single leader versus 23 for a leadership council
- **Selection Vote**: Khamenei elected with 60 votes out of 74
- **Khamenei's Own Opposition**: In video footage, Khamenei opposed his own selection, stating: "I support shuray-e rahbari [leadership council]... How can I be a candidate?"
- **Rafsanjani's Role**: Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani played a key role persuading assembly members, citing a private meeting where Khomeini allegedly indicated Khamenei would be suitable. Rafsanjani was widely credited as the "kingmaker."

### Constitutional Referendum

- **Temporary Appointment**: Khamenei was initially named *provisional* rahbar while amendments were prepared
- **Referendum (August 2, 1989)**: Revised constitution approved by 97.3% (16.4 million yes votes out of 16.8 million cast)
- **Reconfirmation (August 6, 1989)**: Assembly of Experts reconvened and reconfirmed Khamenei with 60 of 64 votes

The constitutional revisions also eliminated the post of prime minister and expanded the powers of both the rahbar and the president.

## 3. Methods of Control

### The Velayat-e Faqih Doctrine

"Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist" (*velayat-e faqih*) is the foundational ideology justifying clerical rule over the state, developed by Ayatollah Khomeini:

- **Theological Basis**: In the absence of the Hidden Twelfth Imam, an Islamic jurist must guide the Muslim community
- **Absolute Authority**: The Supreme Leader has ultimate power over legislature, executive, and judiciary
- **Lifetime Appointment**: The Supreme Leader serves for life, appointed by the Assembly of Experts
- **Constitutional Basis**: Enshrined in Articles 5 and 110 of Iran's constitution

> Source: [Velayat-e Faqih - Ambassador Ausaf Sayeed](https://ausafsayeed.com/velayat-e-faqih-a-foundational-concept-in-irans-governance-and-regional-influence/)

### The Guardian Council

The Guardian Council is a 12-member body wielding enormous constitutional power:

**Composition:**
- 6 Islamic jurists (faqihs) - selected directly by the Supreme Leader
- 6 jurists - elected by Majlis from nominees proposed by the Chief Justice (who is appointed by the Supreme Leader)

**Powers:**
- Vets all legislation for compliance with Islamic law and the constitution
- **Candidate Vetting**: Disqualifies reform-minded candidates from elections
- Controls electoral outcomes by determining who may run
- Favors military (IRGC) candidates over reformers

> Source: [Guardian Council - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Council)

### Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)

The IRGC (*Sepah-e Pasdaran*) was conceived as a "people's army" to defend the revolution. Under Khamenei, it has become perhaps the most powerful institution in Iran:

**Structure:**
- Reports directly to the Supreme Leader (not the president)
- Five branches: Ground Forces, Aerospace Force, Navy, Quds Force (external operations), and Basij

**Powers:**
- Controls approximately 20-40% of Iran's economy
- Dominates infrastructure, energy, telecommunications, and banking sectors
- Key economic entity: Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarters
- Major role in foreign policy through Quds Force operations

**Foreign Operations (Quds Force):**
- Provides training, weapons, and funding to proxy forces
- Key contact point for Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis, and Iraqi militias

### The Basij Militia

The Basij (*Organization for Mobilization of the Oppressed*) is a paramilitary volunteer militia within the IRGC:

**Origins:**
- Established 1979 by Khomeini
- Originally civilian volunteers for Iran-Iraq War

**Current Functions:**
- Internal security and law enforcement
- Morality policing (hijab enforcement)
- Intelligence gathering on students, opposition groups, intellectuals
- Protest suppression (frontline role in 2009, 2019, 2022 crackdowns)

**Human Rights Violations:**
- Documented by Amnesty International and UN for excessive/lethal force
- Responsible for most imprisonments, injuries, and killings during 2022-2023 protests
- 537 killed in Mahsa Amini protests, with Basij at the "forefront"

### Judiciary Control

The Supreme Leader appoints the Head of the Judiciary for five-year terms. This gives Khamenei direct control over:

- The court system
- Prosecution of dissidents
- The Special Court for the Clergy

**Revolutionary Courts:**

The Islamic Revolutionary Courts handle "crimes against the revolution":
- Established by Khomeini to try Pahlavi officials; later expanded
- Jurisdiction: Espionage, blasphemy, "acting against national security," insulting the Supreme Leader
- **No Due Process**: No jury, single judge, closed trials, predetermined verdicts
- Operate in coordination with IRGC and Ministry of Intelligence
- Never incorporated into constitutional judiciary structure - legal standing disputed

## 6. Nuclear Program

### Origins and Early Development

Iran's nuclear program began in the 1950s with U.S. support under the Shah. After the 1979 revolution, the program was initially suspended but later restarted.

### The JCPOA (2015)

The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was signed July 14, 2015 between Iran and the P5+1 (US, UK, France, Russia, China, Germany):

**Iran's Commitments:**
- Reduce uranium stockpile by 98%
- Limit enrichment to 3.67% (weapons-grade is ~90%)
- Reduce centrifuges
- Accept international IAEA inspections

**Benefits to Iran:**
- Lifting of nuclear-related sanctions
- Access to international financial system
- Released frozen assets

**Implementation:** January 16, 2016

### U.S. Withdrawal (2018)

In May 2018, President Donald Trump announced U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA:
- Called it a "horrible, one-sided deal"
- Reimposed economic sanctions ("maximum pressure" campaign)
- Sanctions cut Iran off from international financial system

### Iran's Response and Escalation

Since May 2019, Iran has progressively violated JCPOA limits:
- Stockpile now **30 times** permitted level
- Enrichment increased to **60%** (significantly beyond 3.67% limit)
- As of February 2025: 275 kg of 60% enriched uranium, up from 182 kg in October 2024
- Combined 60%/20% stockpile: nearly 900 kg
- Approximately 118 cascades of centrifuges installed

**Nuclear Threshold:**
- Iran could produce enough highly enriched uranium for one nuclear bomb in **1-2 weeks**
- Neither U.S. intelligence nor IAEA found evidence of active weapons program

- **September 2025**: European powers triggered "snapback" mechanism, reimposing UN sanctions
- **October 18, 2025**: JCPOA officially expired
- Iran announced all restrictions on its nuclear program "terminated"
- September 2025: Iran signed $25 billion deal with Russia for 4 nuclear power reactors

## 7. Foreign Policy: The "Axis of Resistance"

### Overview

The "Axis of Resistance" (*Mehvar-e Moqavemat*) is an informal coalition of Iranian-supported militant and political organizations opposing U.S. and Israeli influence in the Middle East. The name originated as response to George W. Bush's "axis of evil" term.

### Key Members

### The Quds Force

The IRGC's Quds Force serves as the main point of contact with proxy groups:
- Provides training, weaponry, and funds
- Promotes Iranian regional objectives
- Allows Iran to project power while evading direct responsibility

### 2024-2025: Collapse of the Axis

The Axis of Resistance suffered unprecedented setbacks:

**October 2023 - Present:**
- Hamas decimated following October 7 attacks and subsequent Gaza war
- Cannot reconstitute as militia threatening Israel from Gaza

**2024 - Hezbollah:**
- Leadership decapitated (Hassan Nasrallah killed by Israel)
- Operational capability sharply reduced
- Israel's decimation called "the most potent proxy" loss

**December 2024 - Syria:**
- Assad regime collapsed
- 54 years of Assad family rule ended
- Iranian embassy ransacked
- Iranian diplomats and Quds Force commanders fled
- Critical land bridge to Lebanon severed

## 10. Succession Question

### Khamenei's Health

- **Age**: 85 years old (born April 19, 1939)
- **Health Issues**:
  - Prostate carcinoma (confirmed, relatively treatable)
  - Partial paralysis from 1981 assassination attempt
  - Rumored: heart problems, water in lungs
- Declining health accelerating succession discussions

### Mojtaba Khamenei

**Background:**
- Born September 8, 1969 (age 56)
- Second eldest child of Ali Khamenei
- Served in Iran-Iraq War (1987-1988)
- Reportedly controlled Basij during 2009 protest suppression
- Never held public office
- Operates in intelligence/security apparatus outside public eye

**Religious Credentials:**
- Wears clerical robes but lacks theological status
- No leading grand ayatollah has granted teaching license or ayatollah rank
- Religious studies did not advance far

**Succession Prospects:**
- Presumed candidate of choice for his father (especially after President Raisi's death removed another contender)
- November 2024: Israeli media reported Khamenei selected Mojtaba; denied by Tehran Times January 2025

**Challenges:**
- Khomeini opposed hereditary leadership (criticized Shah for it)
- Selection would make Islamic Republic look like "monarchy in all but name"
- Would cause conflict within Iranian political/religious leadership
- Strength of following not demonstrated
- Unconfirmed reports that Khamenei Sr. has opposed nominating his son

### Alternative Candidate

**Hassan Khomeini:**
- Grandson of revolutionary founder Ruhollah Khomeini
- Emerged as potential contender

## 11. Scholarly Debates: Theocratic Authoritarianism

### Classification Debates

Political scientists have struggled to categorize Iran's unique system:

**"Electoral Theocracy":**
Iran combines elements of theocracy with limited democracy. Elections occur regularly, but unelected religious institutions hold ultimate power. Divine sovereignty takes precedence over popular sovereignty.

**"Hybrid Sovereignty":**
The system is "based upon the contradictory principles of divine and popular sovereignty" but with ultimate authority delegated to jurists. This creates tension between democratic aspirations and clerical control.

**Juan Jose Linz (2000):**
Described Iran as combining "the ideological bent of totalitarianism with the limited pluralism of authoritarianism" while still holding "regular elections in which candidates who advocate different policies and incumbents are frequently defeated."

### The Marja'iyyat Problem

A key scholarly debate concerns the religious legitimacy of the Supreme Leader:

- Khomeini was a marja-e taqlid (source of emulation) with highest religious credentials
- Khamenei was only a mid-ranking cleric when selected
- Velayat-e faqih doctrine states religious authority should be the base for political authority
- This contradiction is a source of insecurity for Khamenei
- The 1989 constitutional amendment that allowed his selection remains controversial

### Continuity vs. Revolution

**Revolutionary Origins:**
Khomeini's revolution was explicitly anti-monarchical, criticizing the Shah for hereditary rule and promising meritocratic clerical governance.

**Monarchical Tendencies:**
Some scholars argue the regime has evolved into another form of authoritarianism, with "the same thirst for power manifested by the post-colonial rulers somewhat inherited by Khomeini." The potential succession of Mojtaba Khamenei would represent the ultimate irony.

### The "Elections as Authoritarian Tool" Thesis

Research suggests elections in Iran serve to reinforce authoritarianism:
- Divine institutions always have upper hand over elected ones
- Elections are "at the service of unelected leaders"
- Guardian Council candidate vetting ensures acceptable outcomes
- Reform candidates systematically excluded

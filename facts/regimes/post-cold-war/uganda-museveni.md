# Yoweri Museveni's Uganda (1986-Present)

## Overview

Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has ruled Uganda since January 29, 1986, making his nearly 40-year tenure one of the longest in African history. Originally hailed as a "new breed" of African leader who brought stability after decades of chaos, Museveni's regime has evolved from a hopeful experiment in "no-party democracy" into a consolidated electoral autocracy characterized by constitutional manipulation, systematic repression of opposition, and dynastic succession planning.

---

## Pre-Conditions: The Context of Catastrophe (1962-1986)

### The [[uganda-amin|Idi Amin Era]] (1971-1979)

Uganda's descent into authoritarianism predates Museveni. General Idi Amin seized power in a 1971 coup against Milton Obote, establishing a military dictatorship that became synonymous with brutality.

**Key facts:**
- **Death toll estimates**: 100,000 to 500,000 civilians killed during Amin's eight-year rule [^1]
- The State Research Bureau (SRB), Public Safety Unit (PSU), and Military Police operated as death squads [^2]
- Ethnic massacres targeted Acholi and Lango peoples, perceived as Obote loyalists
- 1972 expulsion of 80,000 Asians devastated the economy
- Amin was overthrown following the 1979 Uganda-Tanzania War

### Obote II and the Luwero Triangle (1980-1985)

Milton Obote returned to power in disputed 1980 elections, triggering a civil war that proved as devastating as Amin's reign.

**Key facts:**
- The 1980 elections were widely considered rigged, providing the immediate cause for armed rebellion [^3]
- **Operation Bonanza (1983)**: A counterinsurgency campaign that forcibly displaced nearly 750,000 people from the Luwero Triangle [^4]
- The International Committee of the Red Cross estimated **over 300,000 civilian deaths** by July 1985 [^5]
- Between 100,000 and 500,000 people died in fighting between the UNLA and guerrilla forces
- Obote was overthrown in July 1985 by Acholi military officers under Tito Okello

### The Bush War (1981-1986)

Yoweri Museveni, who had training with Mozambique's FRELIMO liberation movement, launched a guerrilla insurgency on February 6, 1981, with an attack on Kabamba Military Barracks by just 27 fighters.

**Key developments:**
- The Popular Resistance Army (PRA) merged with Yusuf Lule's Uganda Freedom Fighters to form the National Resistance Movement/Army (NRM/NRA)
- The NRA built support in the Luwero Triangle, recruiting among populations brutalized by Obote's forces
- By December 1985, the NRA had grown to approximately 10,000 troops [^6]
- Peace negotiations with Okello's government failed
- The NRA captured Kampala on January 26, 1986; Museveni was sworn in as president on January 29, 1986

---

## Rise to Power and "No-Party Democracy" (1986-2005)

### The "Movement System"

Upon taking power, Museveni introduced a novel political arrangement that he claimed would prevent the ethnic and sectarian violence of Uganda's past.

**Core features:**
- Political parties were effectively banned (formalized in 1992)
- All citizens were theoretically part of the "Movement" - an all-inclusive political structure
- A pyramid of elected councils from village to national level provided "grassroots democracy"
- Candidates stood on "individual merit" rather than party affiliation
- The NRM's ideology positioned itself as beyond factional politics [^7]

**Rationale provided:**
- Museveni argued that multiparty politics had fueled ethnic violence
- The Movement would consolidate "unity, peace and nationhood" [^8]
- Western-style democracy was deemed unsuitable for African conditions

**Critical assessment:**
Human Rights Watch documented how the Movement system guaranteed NRM's political dominance through:
- Direct access to state resources
- Movement structures exempt from regulations placed on political parties
- Systematic restrictions on opposition political organization [^9]

---

## Methods of Control: Constitutional Engineering

### The 2005 Constitutional Amendment (Removing Term Limits)

The 1995 Constitution limited presidents to two five-year terms. Museveni systematically dismantled this constraint.

**Key facts:**
- Article 105(2) originally capped presidential terms at two
- In 2003, the NRM began the amendment process after a Kyankwanzi retreat
- On July 12, 2005, Parliament amended the Constitution to remove term limits [^10]
- MPs were reportedly paid 5 million Ugandan shillings (~$4,500) for "facilitation" [^11]
- Senior NRM figures who opposed the amendment, including longtime ally Eriya Kategaya, were sacked from Cabinet
- 90+ NGOs launched a campaign opposing the amendment [^12]
- The Constitutional Review Commission had recommended a referendum on the issue, which was bypassed

**Significance:**
Without this amendment, Museveni would have left office in May 2006. Chief Justice Bart Katureebe later stated: "I regret removal of term limits for president" [^13].

### The 2017 Constitutional Amendment (Removing Age Limits)

The Constitution originally required presidential candidates to be under 75 years of age. As Museveni approached this threshold, Parliament again amended the founding document.

**Key facts:**
- On December 20, 2017, Parliament voted 315-62 to remove the age cap (Article 102b) [^14]
- Special Forces Command troops were deployed inside Parliament during the debate [^15]
- Two people were killed during protests against the amendment in October 2017
- **85% of Ugandans opposed the amendment** according to pre-vote polling [^16]
- The amendment also extended parliamentary terms from five to seven years
- Museveni turned 75 in August 2019

---

## Early Achievements and International Praise (1986-2000s)

### HIV/AIDS Response

Uganda was internationally celebrated as an AIDS "success story" in the 1990s.

**Key achievements:**
- HIV prevalence dropped from approximately 15-16% in the early 1990s to about 5% by 2001 [^17]
- Museveni spoke openly about AIDS from 1986, when most African leaders avoided the subject
- The "ABC" approach (Abstain, Be Faithful, Use Condoms) became a model [^18]
- Multi-sectoral mobilization involved government, religious leaders, and civil society
- Uganda won the Africa Prize for Leadership in 1998

**Context and caveats:**
- Scholars debate the relative contributions of each "ABC" component
- Museveni and some religious leaders initially resisted condom promotion
- Later U.S.-backed "abstinence-only" programs were criticized for distorting the original approach [^19]

### Economic Stabilization

Museveni embraced structural adjustment programs, earning praise from international financial institutions.

**Key developments:**
- In May 1987, the Ugandan shilling was devalued 77%
- Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) agreement with IMF signed in 1987
- Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) program from 1989 [^20]
- GDP grew at an average of 6.7% annually from 1990-2015
- The IMF described Uganda's achievements as "impressive" and "setting an example"
- The World Bank and IMF collectively disbursed approximately $1.85 billion between 1987 and 1994 [^21]

**Critical assessment:**
- Museveni had few alternatives; China was not yet a major player, and regional allies could not help
- Privatization and liberalization brought growth but also inequality
- The "darling" status insulated Museveni from political criticism for years

---

## The Lord's Resistance Army Conflict (1987-2006+)

The LRA insurgency in northern Uganda represented one of Africa's most brutal and protracted conflicts, with the Museveni government's response also attracting criticism.

### Origins and Leadership

Joseph Kony founded the LRA in 1987, emerging from earlier Acholi-based resistance movements following the NRA victory.

**Key facts about the LRA:**
- Kony claimed spiritual inspiration, mixing Christianity with traditional beliefs
- The LRA was designated a terrorist organization by the UN, EU, US, and UK [^22]
- At its peak, the LRA had approximately 3,000 fighters

### Atrocities and Humanitarian Impact

**Death toll and displacement:**
- Over 100,000 people killed during the 1990s and 2000s [^23]
- At least 60,000 children abducted [^24]
- 1.9 million people displaced, with nearly 95% of Acholiland's population forced into camps [^25]
- UNICEF estimated at least 25,000 children abducted by 2006

**Notable massacres:**
- February 2004: Barlonyo IDP camp attack killed over 300 people [^26]
- December 2009: Makombo massacre in Congo killed at least 345 civilians

**Methods:**
- Child soldier recruitment
- Mutilations (cutting off lips, ears, noses, hands, feet)
- Sexual violence and forced marriage

### Government Response Controversies

- The government forcibly relocated populations into IDP camps, where conditions were dire
- Critics accused the military of failing to protect civilians and of its own abuses
- Some northern leaders accused Museveni of deliberately neglecting the Acholi region
- Kony was indicted by the ICC in 2005 but remains at large (believed hiding in Kafia Kingi enclave)

---

## Regional Interventions

### First Congo War (1996-1997)

Uganda was a key supporter of the rebellion that overthrew [[zaire-mobutu|Mobutu Sese Seko]].

**Key facts:**
- Uganda worked closely with Rwanda to back Laurent-Désiré Kabila's AFDL
- Museveni had personal ties to Rwandan leaders; many RPF leaders had served in the NRA
- By December 1996, the AFDL controlled 800km of territory along eastern borders
- Kabila seized power in May 1997

### Second Congo War (1998-2003)

Uganda switched sides and invaded its former ally's country.

- On August 4, 1998, Uganda and Rwanda launched Operation Kitona [^27]
- Uganda backed the MLC rebel group under Jean-Pierre Bemba
- Uganda and Rwanda clashed directly in Kisangani (1999-2000)
- In 2022, the International Court of Justice ordered Uganda to pay the DRC **$325 million** for looting gold, diamonds, and timber [^28]

### Relations with [[rwanda-kagame|Rwanda]]

The former close allies became bitter rivals.

**Key developments:**
- The RPF leadership emerged from Uganda's military; [[rwanda-kagame|Paul Kagame]] was an NRA "original"
- Tensions built through the 2000s-2010s
- February 2019: Rwanda closed its border with Uganda [^29]
- Mutual accusations of espionage, supporting dissidents, and assassination plots
- August 2019: Angola-mediated agreement signed, though implementation stalled
- Border reopened January 2022

### AMISOM/Somalia

Uganda has been the largest troop contributor to the African Union mission in Somalia.

**Key facts:**
- Uganda was the first country to deploy troops in 2007, pledging 1,500 soldiers [^30]
- Ugandan forces played a decisive role in driving Al-Shabaab from Mogadishu (2010-2011)
- The deployment enhanced Museveni's international standing and shielded him from criticism
- Uganda committed 4,500 troops to the 2025 AUSSOM mission [^31]

---

## Democratization Reversal and Election Manipulation

### The 2005 Multiparty "Return"

A 2005 referendum restored multiparty politics, but the transition proved superficial.

### Pattern of Electoral Manipulation (2006-2021)

**2006 Election:**
- Main challenger Kizza Besigye was arrested on fabricated treason and rape charges in November 2005 [^32]
- Charges were later dropped as courts found they were "based on falsification and fabrication"
- Supreme Court rejected Besigye's challenge 4-3, but acknowledged electoral irregularities

**2011 Election:**
- "Walk to Work" protests against rising fuel prices were violently suppressed
- Besigye was repeatedly arrested, beaten, and sprayed with pepper spray
- Security forces used tear gas and live ammunition against protesters

**2016 Election:**
- Besigye arrested on election day for alleged vote-rigging investigation [^33]
- Arrested four times in eight days following the election
- EU observers criticized the Electoral Commission's lack of independence [^34]
- Official results: Museveni 61%, Besigye 35%

---

## Contemporary Repression (2018-Present)

### The Persecution of Bobi Wine

Robert Kyagulanyi, known as Bobi Wine, emerged as a new generation opposition leader.

**August 2018:**
- Arrested in Arua after alleged attack on Museveni's convoy
- His driver Yasin Kawuma was shot dead [^35]
- Parliamentary Speaker Rebecca Kadaga described Wine as showing "visible signs of torture and beatings" [^36]
- Lawyers claimed he was injected with unknown substances
- Wine accused the Special Forces Command of the abuse

**2019:**
- Arrested multiple times, including in April for allegedly leading an unauthorized 2018 protest
- Charged with disobedience of statutory duty
- Amnesty International called his detention "a shameless attempt to silence dissent" [^37]

### The 2021 Election: Violence and Shutdown

The January 2021 election represented the most violent in decades.

**Pre-election violence:**
- November 18-19, 2020: Security forces killed at least 54 people during protests following Bobi Wine's arrest [^38]
- Security Minister Elly Tumwine declared police have "the right to shoot you and kill you" [^39]

**Internet shutdown:**
- Complete internet blackout from January 13, 2021 [^40]
- Described as a "textbook case of pre-meditated, pre-election internet blackout"
- Service restored after five days, but social media restrictions continued

**Post-election:**
- Bobi Wine placed under de facto house arrest with hundreds of soldiers surrounding his home
- US Ambassador Natalie Brown blocked from visiting Wine [^41]
- High Court ordered the military to withdraw on January 25, 2021, ruling the confinement unlawful

**International response:**
- US Secretary of State Blinken: the election was "neither free nor fair" [^42]
- Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called for accountability
- Official results: Museveni 58.6%, Bobi Wine 34.8%

### Systematic Torture and Disappearances

Human Rights Watch documented widespread abuse in a March 2022 report.

**Key findings:**
- Hundreds of government critics, opposition supporters, and protesters were detained and tortured [^43]
- "Drones" (unmarked Toyota Hiace vans) used for abductions
- Detainees held in "safe houses" run by the Internal Security Organisation (ISO)
- Torture methods: beatings, electric shocks, injections of unknown substances, rape, sexual torture
- Between 2020 and January 2022, the Uganda Human Rights Commission recorded over 500 torture complaints [^44]

**Case study - Kakwenza Rukirabashaija:**
- Satirical writer forcibly disappeared for 14 days in December 2021
- Military officers broke into his home, beat and blindfolded him
- Later fled to exile

**Lack of accountability:**
- A 2020 Parliamentary human rights committee recommended prosecution of officers; nothing was done
- The former ISO director, Frank Bagyenda, was nominated as ambassador to Angola [^45]

## Corruption and Nepotism

### Transparency International Scores

- 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index: 26/100
- Ranked 140th of 180 countries [^46]

### The Museveni Family in Power

**Muhoozi Kainerugaba (son):**
- Born April 24, 1974
- Trained at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and US Army Command and General Staff College
- Appointed Chief of Defence Forces in March 2024 [^47]

- Multiple other family members hold government and military positions

### The "Muhoozi Project"

The alleged grooming of Museveni's son for succession has been discussed for years.

**Key observations:**
- 2013: A high-ranking officer alleged a secret "Muhoozi Project" including plans to assassinate objectors [^49]
- Muhoozi's supporters argue he offers peaceful transition; critics see hereditary rule emerging
- Analyst Godber Tumushabe: "One has to realize that Museveni is a life president. I don't think that Museveni can allow his son to be president when he is alive" [^50]

---

## Scholarly Debates: Liberation Movements Becoming Authoritarian

Uganda exemplifies a broader pattern examined in academic literature on African liberation movements.

### Roger Southall's Framework

In *Liberation Movements in Power: Party and State in Southern Africa* (2013), Southall argues that such movements are "characterised by paradoxical qualities, both emancipatory and authoritarian" [^52].

### The "Liberation Movement Syndrome"

De Jager and Steenekamp (2016) identified key features:
- Self-conception as "the leader, voice and embodiment of the people"
- Preeminence of liberationist culture where group responsibility supersedes individual rights [^53]

### Key Mechanisms of Authoritarian Transition

1. **Wartime habits**: "Resistance movements normally adopt survival strategies and techniques, which resemble oppressive elements for internal control while fighting an oppressive regime. That culture... was nurtured by continued suspicion if not elimination... of all dissenting voices even after the liberation struggle ended" [^54]

2. **The "national interest" justification**: Any opposition is framed as "anti-national" or "unpatriotic," if not working for "regime change" at the behest of Western imperialists [^55]

3. **Military mindset**: "The rule of liberation movements is rooted in using force to overthrow undemocratic, repressive conditions. A military mindset guided by a confrontational 'we-they' divide isn't favourable for strengthening human rights, civil liberties and democratic norms" [^56]

4. **Seeds planted during struggle**: "Liberation struggles that valued loyalty over debate, command over consensus, and violence over dialogue could not have nurtured democratic cultures" [^57]

### Comparative Cases

Similar trajectories observed in:
- ZANU-PF (Zimbabwe) since 1980
- SWAPO (Namibia) since 1990
- ANC (South Africa) since 1994
- FRELIMO (Mozambique)
- MPLA (Angola)
- RPF ([[rwanda-kagame|Rwanda]]) since 1994

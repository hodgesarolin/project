# Xi Jinping's China (2012-Present)

## Overview

Xi Jinping has ruled the People's Republic of China since November 15, 2012, when he was elected General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). His tenure represents a dramatic reversal of the post-Mao collective leadership norms established by Deng Xiaoping, consolidating power to a degree unseen since Mao Zedong. The regime is characterized by the abolition of term limits, a sweeping anti-corruption campaign used to eliminate rivals, unprecedented surveillance capabilities, genocide against Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the crushing of Hong Kong's autonomy, and an increasingly assertive foreign policy.

---

## 1. Pre-Conditions: The Reform Era (1978-2012)

### Deng Xiaoping's Collective Leadership System

After Mao's death in 1976, Deng Xiaoping emerged as China's paramount leader by 1978 and launched sweeping economic reforms. Critically, Deng established institutional safeguards against personal dictatorship:

- **Term limits**: Two five-year terms for the presidency (1982 constitutional amendment)
- **Mandatory retirement ages** for officials
- **Delegation of authority** from the Communist Party to government agencies
- **Regular meetings** of Party institutions to decentralize authority

> "Over-concentration of power is liable to give rise to arbitrary rule by individuals at the expense of collective leadership." - Deng Xiaoping ([Journal of Democracy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/china-in-xis-new-era-the-return-to-personalistic-rule/))

This system produced two peaceful leadership successions: Jiang Zemin (1989-2002) and Hu Jintao (2002-2012). ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-China/China-after-the-death-of-Mao))

### Endemic Corruption

Despite economic growth, corruption became deeply entrenched during the reform era:

- Corruption was perceived as having reversed from the 1980s: "more dishonest CCP officials than honest ones" ([Wikipedia - Corruption in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_China))
- Minxin Pei estimated bribery, kickbacks, and theft cost at least 3% of GDP ([Carnegie Endowment](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2015/05/the-truth-about-chinese-corruption?lang=en))
- Cadre corruption was a root cause of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests
- Wen Jiabao's family controlled assets of at least $2.7 billion; Xi's own extended family held over $1 billion ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_China))

---

## 2. Rise to Power (2012)

### Princeling Background

Xi Jinping is the son of Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary veteran who served as deputy prime minister. As a "princeling" (child of revolutionary heroes), Xi's path was shaped by party connections, though his father's purge during the Cultural Revolution temporarily derailed his trajectory. ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Xi-Jinping))

Xi spent seven years as a peasant in rural Liangjiahe Village during the Cultural Revolution exile. He later rose through:
- Governor of Fujian (1999-2002)
- Governor and Party Secretary of Zhejiang (2002-2007)
- Party Secretary of Shanghai (2007)
- Politburo Standing Committee member (October 2007)

### The Bo Xilai Rivalry

Xi's succession was threatened by the rise of Bo Xilai, the charismatic Party Secretary of Chongqing. Bo's downfall came with the Wang Lijun incident in 2012, "which opened the door for Xi to come to power without challengers." ([Wikipedia - Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping))

### Elevation to General Secretary

On November 15, 2012, immediately after the 18th Party Congress, Xi was elected:
- General Secretary of the CCP
- Chairman of the Central Military Commission
- He became the first paramount leader born after the founding of the PRC

By 2016, Xi was proclaimed the CCP's fourth "leadership core," following Mao, Deng, and Jiang. ([Wikipedia - General Secretaryship of Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_secretaryship_of_Xi_Jinping))

---

## 3. Anti-Corruption Campaign as Consolidation Tool

### Overview

The anti-corruption campaign launched after the 18th National Congress in 2012 became "the most extensive and systematic anti-corruption effort in the history of CCP governance." ([Wikipedia - Anti-corruption campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corruption_campaign_under_Xi_Jinping))

Xi vowed to crack down on both "tigers" (senior leaders) and "flies" (low-level bureaucrats).

### Scale of the Campaign

Official statistics (2013-2021):
- Over **4 million officials** prosecuted on corruption charges
- **392 officials** at or above provincial level
- **17,000** at county level
- Over **616,000** at township level

According to Yuen Yuen Ang, this became the "longest, widest-ranging, and most penetrative" bureaucratic purge in contemporary Chinese history. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corruption_campaign_under_Xi_Jinping))

### High-Profile "Tigers" Brought Down

- **Zhou Yongkang**: Former Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission
- **Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong**: Former Vice-Chairmen of the Central Military Commission
- **Ling Jihua**: Former Director of the General Office of the CCP (Hu Jintao's senior aide)
- **Su Rong**: Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

([China Perspectives](https://journals.openedition.org/chinaperspectives/6542))

### Dual Purpose: Reform and Power Consolidation

> "Xi is pursuing both goals. Xi wants a pure party, but he is also using the campaign to purge officials who do not owe their loyalty to him." ([Wilson Center](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/the-mixed-rationales-and-mixed-results-xi-jinpings-anticorruption-campaign))

> "The campaign has sent out a clear signal that Xi and his allies have now consolidated political power against rival factions, and that any political opposition to Xi personally or economic reforms generally can be ruthlessly removed." ([China Perspectives](https://journals.openedition.org/chinaperspectives/6542))

Xi used the campaign to eliminate key members of:
- The **Shanghai faction** (led by former President Jiang Zemin)
- The **Youth League faction** (led by former President Hu Jintao)

---

## 4. Methods of Control

### Abolishing Term Limits (2018)

On March 11, 2018, China's National People's Congress voted to abolish presidential term limits:
- **2,958 voted yes** out of 2,963 delegates
- **2 voted against**, 3 abstained

This upended the system enacted by Deng Xiaoping in 1982 "to prevent a return to the bloody excesses of a lifelong dictatorship typified by Mao Zedong's chaotic 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution." ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/11/592694991/china-removes-presidential-term-limits-enabling-xi-jinping-to-rule-indefinitely))

Additional 2018 constitutional changes:
- Addition of **"Xi Jinping Thought"** to the constitution
- Creation of politically driven **"supervisory commissions"** to investigate party members

Criticism was "largely censored on the Internet." Businesswoman Wang Ying posted that the proposal was "against the tides" and "an outright betrayal." ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/3/11/china-parliament-scraps-presidential-term-limits))

### The Surveillance State

#### Scale of Surveillance

- **200-400 million** CCTV cameras in China (estimates vary)
- Ratio: approximately **1 camera per 7 citizens**
- Integration of **facial recognition**, gait recognition, and behavioral analytics
- **"Skynet"** and **"Sharp Eyes"** projects expanded high-definition cameras across urban and rural areas

([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/05/953515627/facial-recognition-and-beyond-journalist-ventures-inside-chinas-surveillance-sta), [ORF](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/china-s-social-credit-system-and-information-control-regime))

#### Facial Recognition and Behavior Monitoring

- Cameras in Shenzhen watch intersections; jaywalkers are publicly shamed when their faces are displayed on screens
- In May 2021, AI and facial recognition systems "intended to reveal states of emotion" were tested in Xinjiang
- Cameras recognize faces, how people walk, and can track location as they move

([PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-chinas-high-tech-eyes-monitor-behavior-and-dissent))

### Social Credit System

The system functions through **blacklists and redlists** rather than a single score:

**Consequences for blacklisted individuals:**
- No plane tickets or high-speed rail
- Exclusion from expensive hotels
- Children barred from good schools
- Employment restrictions

**Scale:**
- By 2022, over **7.2 million individuals** designated "untrustworthy persons"
- In 2018, **more than 17 million people** were banned from flying
- Lawyer Li Xiaolin was stranded 1,200 miles from home after a court apology was deemed "insincere"

([Time](https://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502592/china-social-credit-score/), [ORF](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/china-s-social-credit-system-and-information-control-regime))

### The Great Firewall

The Great Firewall is "the world's most sophisticated internet censorship apparatus":

- Over **200,000 blocked domains** (GFWatch)
- Over **100,000 websites blocked** as of February 2024 (GreatFire.org)
- Blocked sites include: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, foreign news sites, anything related to democracy or human rights

**2024 Developments:**
- April 2024: New QUIC protocol censorship implemented
- April 2024: Apple ordered to remove WhatsApp, Threads, Telegram, and Signal from China App Store
- VPN blocking intensified; only **~3% of Chinese netizens** use VPNs (2022 estimate)

([Wikipedia - Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall), [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-net/2024))

## 5. Xinjiang: Uyghur Genocide

### Overview

Beginning in 2017, under Xi Jinping's administration and led by Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, China established mass internment camps for Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.

### Scale of Detention

- **1-1.8 million** Uyghurs detained since 2017 (international researchers, U.S. officials)
- Some estimates reach **2 million** including ethnic Kazakhs and Uzbeks
- **500,000+** currently imprisoned (2022-present)
- **3 million** subjected to forced labor (2023)
- Despite comprising **less than 1%** of China's population, Uyghurs account for **34%** of incarcerations - the world's highest rate of ethnic imprisonment

([CFR](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-xinjiang-uyghurs-muslims-repression-genocide-human-rights), [US Holocaust Memorial Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/genocide-prevention/countries/china/chinese-persecution-of-the-uyghurs), [RFA](https://www.rfa.org/english/uyghur/2025/02/27/uyghur-us-report-chinas-atrocities-xinjiang/))

### Methods of Repression

The campaign is "multi-faceted and systematic":
- **Mass detention** without legal process
- **Intense surveillance** with technology-enabled monitoring
- **Forced labor** (documented in cotton, textiles, solar panels)
- **Family separation**
- **Forced sterilization** and involuntary contraceptive use
- **Sexual abuse** including forced abortions
- **Forced assimilation** and "reeducation"

([U.S. State Department](https://www.state.gov/forced-labor-in-chinas-xinjiang-region), [U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/against-their-will-the-situation-in-xinjiang))

### Death Toll Estimates

Death figures are difficult to verify due to lack of access:
- **Ethan Gutmann** (researcher): Estimated 5-10% annual mortality rate in camps
- **Xinjiang Victims Database**: 225 documented prison deaths (as of November 2023)
- **One camp reported**: At least 150 deaths over six months at a single facility
- Former detainee Mihrigul Tursun reported 9 women died in her camp during 3 months of detention

([Wikipedia - Persecution of Uyghurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Uyghurs_in_China), [RFA](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/deaths-10292019181322.html/))

### Genocide Determination

- **United States**: Formally determined genocide (January 2021)
- **UK Parliament, Canadian Parliament, Dutch Parliament**: Declared genocide
- **UN Human Rights Office** (August 2022): "May constitute crimes against humanity"
- **Uyghur Tribunal** (December 2021): Found genocide via birth control and forced sterilization

([CFR](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-xinjiang-uyghurs-muslims-repression-genocide-human-rights), [ODNI Report](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/reports-publications/reports-publications-2024/4017-uyghur-genocide))

### Forced Labor and Global Supply Chains

- Xinjiang produces **~20% of the world's cotton**
- **83 major brands** implicated in forced labor supply chains
- **Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act** (U.S., enacted December 2021) creates rebuttable presumption against Xinjiang goods
- Forced labor documented in at least **17 industries** including apparel, food, mining, green energy, automotive

([Business & Human Rights Resource Centre](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/china-83-major-brands-implicated-in-report-on-forced-labour-of-ethnic-minorities-from-xinjiang-assigned-to-factories-across-provinces-includes-company-responses/), [State Department](https://www.state.gov/office-to-monitor-and-combat-trafficking-in-persons/releases/2025/01/uyghur-forced-labor-prevention-act-uflpa-fact-sheet))

## 6. Hong Kong: Crushing the Pro-Democracy Movement

### The National Security Law (June 30, 2020)

Beijing imposed the National Security Law on Hong Kong, bypassing the territory's own Legislative Council. It criminalizes:
- **Subversion**
- **Secession**
- **Terrorism**
- **Collusion with foreign forces**

Article 38 extends jurisdiction to **foreign nationals outside Hong Kong** who could be arrested upon arrival. ([Wikipedia - 2020 Hong Kong NSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Hong_Kong_national_security_law))

### Arrests and Prosecutions

- **326 people arrested** under NSL and related laws (as of June 2025)
- **Over 10,000 arrested** in citywide crackdown since 2019 protests
- **At least 2,800 prosecuted** under public order charges or colonial-era sedition laws

([CFR](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hong-kong-freedoms-democracy-protests-china-crackdown), [UK Parliament](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9318/))

### The "Hong Kong 47" Case

The largest trial under the NSL sentenced pro-democracy activists to up to **10 years in prison** for organizing an unofficial primary election in July 2020:
- **Benny Tai** (law professor, organizer): 10 years - longest NSL sentence
- The primary drew **over 600,000 voters**
- U.S. and Western governments called the trial "politically motivated"

([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-47-democracy-activists-sentenced-national-security-rcna180290), [UN News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157166))

### Jimmy Lai

Jimmy Lai, founder of Apple Daily newspaper, was detained in 2020:
- Trial concluded after nearly 5 years
- Placed in **solitary confinement**
- Found guilty of foreign collusion, sedition, fraud, unauthorized assembly

([CFR](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hong-kong-freedoms-democracy-protests-china-crackdown))

### Impact on Media and Civil Society

- **Apple Daily** newspaper forced to close (June 2021)
- **At least 900 journalists** lost jobs since 2020
- Press Freedom Index ranking fell from **73rd (2019)** to **135th (2024)** out of 180 countries
- **Democratic Party** (Hong Kong's largest opposition group) disbanded (March 2025)

([CFR](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hong-kong-freedoms-democracy-protests-china-crackdown), [UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/china-country-policy-and-information-notes/country-policy-and-information-note-hong-kong-national-security-legislation-china-april-2025))

## 7. Tibet: Continued Repression

### Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism

In August 2020, Xi stated it is "necessary to actively guide Tibetan Buddhism to adapt to the socialist society and promote the Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism." ([Wikipedia - Sinicization of Tibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinicization_of_Tibet))

At the 2017 CCP Congress, Xi emphasized religions must be "Chinese-oriented" and incorporate socialist values.

### Methods of Religious Repression

- Tibetans forced to **remove portraits of the Dalai Lama** and replace them with pictures of Xi Jinping
- Forced to **prostrate and make offerings** to Xi's portrait (a practice traditionally reserved for Buddha)
- Monks forced to study Xi Jinping Thought and **publicly defame the Dalai Lama**
- "Patriotic education" widespread in monasteries

([Central Tibetan Administration](https://tibet.net/tibetans-forced-to-prostrate-to-xi-jinping-pictures-religious-repression-in-tibet-accelerates/), [Harvard International Review](https://hir.harvard.edu/repression-tibetan-buddhism-china/))

### Destruction of Buddhist Institutions

- 2019: **Thousands of residences demolished** at Yachen Gar Buddhist center, displacing up to 6,000 monks and nuns
- April 2019: **Larung Gar Buddhist Academy** closed to new enrollment
- December 2021: **30-meter Buddha statue** and 45 large prayer wheels destroyed

([Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/report/2017/battle-china-spirit-tibetan-buddhism-religious-freedom), [ICT Blog](https://weblog.savetibet.org/2024/09/new-cultural-revolution-in-tibet-xis-cultural-ideology-aims-to-erase-tibets-identity/))

### Cultural Erasure

- Tibetan-language instruction increasingly ceased under Xi
- Regulations requiring Tibetan as main language in schools eliminated in 2002
- Critics say Xi believes "the best way for China to conquer Tibet is to 'kill the Tibetan in the child'"

([Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/LC74607/text))

### Self-Immolations

**At least 156 Tibetans** have self-immolated since February 2009 in protest of repressive policies. ([Harvard International Review](https://hir.harvard.edu/repression-tibetan-buddhism-china/))

---

## 8. Zero-COVID Policy and 2022 Protests

### The Zero-COVID Approach

China maintained strict "zero-COVID" policies for nearly three years (2020-2022):
- Citywide lockdowns
- Mass testing
- Strict quarantines
- Digital tracking

### The White Paper Protests (November 2022)

Protests erupted following a fire at a high-rise apartment in Urumqi on November 24, 2022:
- Locked doors and COVID measures allegedly **hindered escape and firefighting**
- Urumqi residents had been locked down for **over three months**
- Protests spread to **at least eight major cities**

In Shanghai, crowds chanted: **"Xi Jinping! Step down! CCP! Step down!"**

Protesters held blank white paper (traditional mourning color) - giving rise to the name "A4 Revolution" or "White Paper Protests."

([Wikipedia - 2022 COVID-19 protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_COVID-19_protests_in_China), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/china/china-protests-xinjiang-fire-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html))

### Sudden Policy Reversal

Xi's "sudden abandonment of zero-COVID at the beginning of December 2022 was the most dramatic reversal of a signature policy for which he had taken enormous credit."

**Impact of the reversal:**
- Estimated **80% of population infected** between early December and mid-January 2023 (Chinese CDC)
- Official figure: **~60,000 hospital deaths** (December 8, 2022 - January 14, 2023) - widely disputed
- The reversal occurred "so soon after the CCP's 20th Congress in October, which had championed the superiority of China's COVID handling"

([China Leadership Monitor](https://www.prcleader.org/post/the-sudden-end-of-zero-covid-an-investigation), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/5/chinas-zero-covid-u-turn-leads-to-loss-of-faith-in-leadership))

---

## 9. Foreign Policy

### Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)

Launched in 2013 as Xi's "project of the century":
- **~150 countries** signed memoranda of understanding
- **$1+ trillion** in total investment (8x the Marshall Plan in today's dollars)
- Projects span infrastructure, energy, ports, and IT networks

([CFR](https://www.cfr.org/blog/rise-and-fall-bri))

#### "Debt Trap Diplomacy" Debate

The term originated in 2017 regarding China's 99-year lease of Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port.

**Countries at high risk of debt distress** from BRI loans (Center for Global Development):
- Djibouti, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Maldives, Mongolia, Montenegro, Pakistan, Tajikistan

**Counter-arguments:**
- Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Chatham House dispute the "debt trap" narrative
- "Chinese banks have never actually seized an asset from any country"
- Problems often stem from "misconduct of local elites" rather than predatory lending

**Current status:** China has transitioned from "world's largest official creditor" to "world's largest official debt collector" with over **$1.1 trillion** in debt. ([Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/21/china-debt-diplomacy-belt-and-road-initiative-economy-infrastructure-development/), [Chatham House](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/08/debunking-myth-debt-trap-diplomacy))

### South China Sea Militarization

China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea via the "nine-dash line":
- **Estimated 11 billion barrels** of untapped oil
- **190 trillion cubic feet** of natural gas

**Island Building (2013-2015):**
- Created **~5 square miles** of artificial landmasses on seven features in the Spratly Islands
- **Three fully militarized** artificial islands (Subi, Fiery Cross, Mischief reefs)
- Features include: 10,000-foot runways, aircraft hangars, missile systems, fighter jets

**2016 Arbitration Ruling:**
- International tribunal ruled China lacks historical titles within the nine-dash line
- Artificial islands do not afford territorial waters under UNCLOS
- China **rejected the ruling**

([CFR](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/territorial-disputes-south-china-sea), [Wikipedia - South China Sea disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea))

### Taiwan Tensions

Xi has made reunification with Taiwan central to his "China Dream":

> "The reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable!" - Xi Jinping, New Year's Eve address ([Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/chinas-xi-taiwan-territorial-claim-war-games-11287856))

**Military Activities:**
- Taiwan detected **89 aircraft and 28 vessels** in one day during 2024 exercises - largest since 2022
- U.S. defense officials believe Xi has directed the PLA to be capable of moving against Taiwan **by end of 2027**
- Beijing has not ruled out the use of force

**U.S. Response:**
- Approved **$11 billion arms package** for Taiwan (one of largest in recent years)
- Regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in Taiwan Strait

([CFR](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump), [Chatham House](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/03/chinas-military-build-indicates-it-serious-about-taking-taiwan))

### Wolf Warrior Diplomacy

A confrontational diplomatic style that emerged under Xi:
- Named after nationalist action movies
- Chinese diplomats adopted **aggressive, nationalistic rhetoric**
- **Zhao Lijian** became prominent through fiery tweets defending China
- Focus on "core interests": Xinjiang, Taiwan, Hong Kong

**Rise and Decline:**
- Peaked around 2019-2022
- Declined after 2022 under apparent orders from Xi
- By early 2025, belligerent statements returned to 2018 levels
- Widely seen as "undiplomatic and counterproductive"

([Wikipedia - Wolf warrior diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_warrior_diplomacy), [The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2023/09/the-rise-and-fall-of-chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomacy/), [Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/have-chinas-wolf-warriors-gone-extinct))

## 10. Cult of Personality

### Development Since 2012

A cult of personality has developed around Xi since 2012, reversing Deng Xiaoping's efforts to prevent another Mao:

**Official Titles:**
- **"Lingxiu"** (领袖) - reverent term for "leader," previously only given to Mao
- **"Great Helmsman"**
- **"Eternal core"** of the party (July 2018)
- **"People's Leader"** (人民领袖) - a title only Mao held previously (December 2019)

([Wikipedia - Xi Jinping's cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping's_cult_of_personality), [TIME](https://time.com/6287699/xi-jinping-personality-cult/))

### Xi Jinping Thought

"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era" became:
- **Written into the CCP charter** (2017)
- **Written into the constitution** (2018)
- **Core of university curricula** since October 2017 - first time since Mao

Fudan University revised its charter to:
- Remove "academic independence and freedom of thought"
- Include "pledge to follow the Communist party's leadership"
- "Equip its teachers and employees" with Xi Jinping Thought

([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping's_cult_of_personality), [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/08/the-personality-cult-of-xi-jinping-china-leader-communist-party/))

### Propaganda

- Books, cartoons, pop songs, dance routines honoring Xi's rule
- Liangjiahe village (where Xi was sent during Cultural Revolution) decorated with propaganda murals
- Media controls intensified: all news organizations owe loyalty to the party

The CCP officially denies any cult of personality, claiming "respect and love" for Xi is "natural" and "heartfelt." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping's_cult_of_personality))

### High-Profile Disappearances

Pattern of critics, businesspeople, and celebrities vanishing:

| Person | Occupation | Circumstances |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Jack Ma** | Alibaba founder | Disappeared after October 2020 speech criticizing regulators |
| **Fan Bingbing** | Actress | Vanished July 2018; resurfaced October with tax evasion apology, $130M fine |
| **Ren Zhiqiang** | Real estate mogul | Disappeared March 2020 after criticizing Xi's COVID handling; sentenced to 18 years |
| **Gui Minhai** | Publisher | Abducted from Thailand 2015; sentenced to 10 years for "illegally providing intelligence overseas" |
| **Peng Shuai** | Tennis star | Disappeared after accusing former official of sexual assault (2021) |

## 11. Economic Issues

## 12. Scholarly Debates: Totalitarianism vs. Authoritarianism

### The Case for Totalitarianism

Some scholars argue China under Xi meets the definition of totalitarianism:

> "China is the inventor of a new 21st century techno-totalitarianism... [it] possesses all the tools of classic totalitarianism—and many new ones of its own invention." ([Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/10/china-xi-jinping-totalitarian-authoritarian-debate/))

Using Brzezinski's framework, Heritage Foundation analysis finds China "is already totalitarian in five of the six traits... Only with regard to a centrally controlled economy do we find an authoritarian rather than a strict totalitarian structure." ([Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/china/commentary/china-totalitarian))

Chinese dissident Deng Yuwen argues: "Only Xi Jinping's China, with its size and surging ambition, stands as the last totalitarian regime in human history, following Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union." ([Reading the China Dream](https://www.readingthechinadream.com/deng-yuwen-on-xi-jinpings-totalitarianism.html))

### The "Neo-Totalitarian" or "Neo-Stalinist" Framework

Political scientist **Minxin Pei** argues: "Since Xi Jinping became paramount leader in 2012, the CCP has reverted to a neo-Stalinist path," characterized by:
- Personality cult of a dominant ruler
- Constant purges within the regime
- Intense repression
- Reassertion of Leninist party-state supremacy
- Ideological hostility to the West

**David Shambaugh**, prominent China scholar, characterizes post-2012 China as a "neo-totalitarian era." ([Journal of Democracy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/china-totalitarianisms-long-shadow/), [Project MUSE](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/725994/pdf))

### The Case for Authoritarianism

Official Western government classifications:
- **Human Rights Watch**: "A one-party authoritarian state that systemically curbs fundamental rights"
- **U.S. State Department**: "An authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount authority"
- **Freedom House**: "Authoritarian regime"

### Key Distinctions

The debate centers on whether China's control extends to **shaping citizens' thoughts** (totalitarian) versus primarily **controlling behavior** (authoritarian):

> "Totalitarianism creates an ideological system to shape and control the people's thoughts, so that they meekly follow the leader." ([Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/china/commentary/china-totalitarian))

**Critiques of the totalitarian label:**
- May not "fully capture the complexities and dynamics within Chinese society"
- State control does not necessarily increase in sync with state autonomy
- "Degree and form of state reach fluctuate over time and across different policy areas"

([CFR](https://www.cfr.org/blog/totalism-and-state-society-relations-china), [The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2025/12/totalitarianism-in-china-resurrected-and-rejuvenated-by-reform/))

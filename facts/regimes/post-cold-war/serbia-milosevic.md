## Overview

Slobodan Milosevic (1941-2006) served as President of Serbia (1989-1997) and President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1997-2000). He played a central role in the violent breakup of Yugoslavia and became the first sitting head of state charged with war crimes by an international tribunal. His regime was characterized by the instrumental use of Serbian nationalism, control of state media, reliance on security services and paramilitaries, and involvement in four wars that caused approximately 130,000-140,000 deaths and displaced over 4 million people.

## 1. Pre-Conditions for Rise

### Tito's Death and the Power Vacuum (1980)

On May 4, 1980, Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito died, removing what many observers considered Yugoslavia's main unifying force. The 1974 constitution had established a collective presidency rotating among representatives of the six republics and two autonomous provinces, creating a weak federal structure prone to gridlock.

> Milton Friedman and his wife Rose Friedman foretold in their 1980 book *Free to Choose*: "Once the aged Marshal Tito dies, Yugoslavia will experience political instability that may produce a reaction toward greater authoritarianism or, far less likely, a collapse of existing collectivist arrangements."

### Economic Crisis of the 1980s

Yugoslavia faced severe economic deterioration following Tito's death:

- **Foreign debt**: Nearly $20 billion at Tito's passing
- **Growth collapse**: Average GDP growth only 1.1% (1980-1989), then -11.6% in 1990
- **Unemployment**: Reached 16% by late 1980s
- **Regional disparities**: Growing gap between wealthy northern republics (Slovenia, Croatia) and poorer southern regions

The economic crisis contributed to resentment between regions, with wealthier republics increasingly unwilling to make transfers to poorer areas, fueling separatist sentiments.

### Kosovo Albanian Tensions

The autonomous province of Kosovo, with its predominantly ethnic Albanian population and its significance in Serbian national mythology (site of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo), became a focal point of tensions. Serbian nationalists claimed Serbs in Kosovo faced harassment and discrimination from the Albanian-dominated provincial government, while Albanians sought greater autonomy or independence.

### The SANU Memorandum (1986)

In September 1986, a draft document from the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) was leaked to the press. The memorandum claimed:

- Yugoslavia's constitutional structure discriminated against Serbs
- Serbia's development was eroded in favor of other republics
- Serbs in Kosovo and Croatia faced "genocide" and discrimination
- 500,000 Serbs had left Kosovo between 1690 and 1912 due to Albanian persecution

Though officially denounced by the Yugoslav and Serbian governments in 1986 (including by Milosevic himself, who called it "the darkest nationalism"), the memorandum later served as an intellectual foundation for Serbian nationalist politics.

## 2. Rise to Power

### Early Life and Communist Career

- **Born**: August 20, 1941, in Pozarevac, Serbia
- **Family**: Parents were schoolteachers from Montenegro; father abandoned family in 1947; both parents later died by suicide
- **Education**: Law degree from University of Belgrade (1964)
- **Party membership**: Full Communist Party member at age 17 (1959)
- **Patron**: Ivan Stambolic, whose connections helped Milosevic advance

Career progression:
- 1968: Deputy director of Tehnogas (state gas company)
- 1973: Chairman of Tehnogas
- 1978: Head of Beobanka (major Yugoslav bank)
- 1984: President of Belgrade League of Communists
- 1986: Serbian regional Communist Party President

### The Kosovo Polje Speech (April 24, 1987)

The pivotal moment in Milosevic's transformation from communist apparatchik to nationalist leader came on April 24, 1987, in Kosovo Polje. Sent to address a crowd of aggrieved Kosovo Serbs, Milosevic emerged from a meeting when Serbian demonstrators clashed with Kosovo Albanian police.

His declaration to the crowd - "No one should dare to bite you" - electrified Serbian nationalism.

> "This sentence enthroned him as a tsar," said one organizer of the protest.

His mentor Stambolic later reflected that he saw that day as "the end of Yugoslavia."

### The 1989 Gazimestan Speech

On June 28, 1989, Milosevic delivered the Gazimestan speech to mark the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo, before an estimated crowd of one million. The speech's reference to the possibility of "armed battles" in Serbia's future has been seen as presaging the Yugoslav Wars.

Sources: [Gazimestan Speech - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazimestan_speech)

### The Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution (1988-1989)

Between 1988 and 1989, Milosevic supporters organized massive street protests across Serbia and other Yugoslav republics:

- **June 1988**: 5,000 protesters at Zmaj factory
- **July-August 1988**: Meetings in dozens of towns with tens of thousands
- **September 1988**: Protests in 39 towns with over 400,000 people
- **October 5, 1988**: 150,000 in Novi Sad against Vojvodina provincial government
- **November 19, 1988**: Usce rally in Belgrade - estimated 500,000 to 1 million

The protests forced resignations of regional governments labeled "bureaucrats," replacing them with Milosevic loyalists. By early 1989, Milosevic had pushed through a new constitution drastically reducing autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina.

## 3. Methods of Control

### Media Capture: Radio Television of Serbia (RTS)

State television became the primary instrument of regime propaganda:

- **Centralization**: In 1992, RTS absorbed regional broadcasters into a centralized, regime-controlled network
- **Purges**: Nearly 1,000 media professionals were fired in the early 1990s
- **Dominance**: 69% of the population relied on state television as their primary news source; over 60% watched RTS's *Dnevnik* (Daily News)
- **Propaganda techniques**: Critics were labeled "traitors" and "foreign mercenaries"; war crimes were denied or blamed on victims

> A former Reuters correspondent noted: "Serbian Radio Television created a strange universe in which Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, had never been besieged and in which the devastated Croatian town of Vukovar had been 'liberated'."

In 2011, RTS formally apologized for "insults, slander and hate speech" during the Milosevic era.

### Security Services and Paramilitaries

The State Security Service (SDB), reorganized as the State Security Directorate in 1991, was central to Milosevic's power:

**Key figure**: Jovica Stanisic, head of Serbian State Security, commanded approximately 4,000 personnel and was considered the most powerful man in Serbia after Milosevic.

**Activities**:
- Surveillance of opposition leaders, journalists, and their families
- Formation and support of paramilitary units
- Assassination of political opponents (journalist Slavko Curuvija murdered in 1999)

**Paramilitary forces** operating with state support included:
- **Arkan's Tigers** (Serbian Volunteer Guard): Led by Zeljko Raznatovic, recruited from Red Star Belgrade football ultras and criminals
- **Scorpions**: Implicated in war crimes including Srebrenica
- **Knindze**: Early paramilitary unit

> "Arkan's unit was for all intents and purposes a unit of the State Security Service of the Ministry of Interior of Serbia, MUP. Had the MUP opposed Arkan, the unit would simply not have been able to exist."

### Controlled Opposition and Elections

While nominally transitioning to a multi-party system in 1990, Milosevic maintained power through:
- Media dominance limiting opposition access
- Security service surveillance of opponents
- Manipulation of electoral processes
- Intimidation and occasional violence against opposition figures

## 4. The Yugoslav Wars

### Ten-Day War - Slovenia (June-July 1991)

- **Duration**: June 27 - July 7, 1991
- **Casualties**: Fewer than 70 total deaths
- **Outcome**: Slovenia gained independence; Yugoslav army withdrew by October 1991

Slovenia's ethnic homogeneity and lack of significant Serbian population made Milosevic willing to let it go relatively easily.

## 6. Economic Collapse

### UN Sanctions (1992-1995, 1998-2001)

International sanctions imposed in May 1992 devastated the Serbian economy:

- GDP dropped from $24 billion (1990) to below $10 billion (1993)
- Isolated economy forced reliance on smuggling and black markets

### Hyperinflation (1992-1994)

Serbia experienced the **second-longest hyperinflation in world history**:

- Duration: 22 months (March 1992 - January 1994)
- Peak monthly rate: **313 million percent** (January 1994)
- Daily inflation: 62%
- Hourly inflation: 2.03%
- Annualized rate: 116.5 trillion percent

**Causes**:
- Unrestrained money printing to fund wars
- Collapse of Yugoslav single market
- UN sanctions
- Corruption and inefficiency

**Social impact**:
- 39% of population living on less than $2/month (1993)
- 800,000 people emigrated (20% with higher education)
- Personal savings wiped out

### Organized Crime State

The combination of sanctions, war, and institutional collapse created a criminal-state nexus:

> "Serbian society was exposed to the criminalization of society, forced to introduce illegal trading as a way to overcome economic isolation."

- Smuggling routes for fuel, cigarettes, arms became formalized criminal enterprises
- State actors took bribes and protection payments from criminal networks
- Paramilitaries often doubled as organized crime groups
- Regime relied on illicit revenues to circumvent embargoes

## 7. Fall from Power

### The Otpor Movement (1998-2000)

Founded by students in October 1998, **Otpor** ("Resistance") became the driving force behind Milosevic's downfall:

- **Origin**: Response to 1998 University Law restricting academic freedom
- **Structure**: Horizontal leadership, grassroots organizing
- **Methods**: Exclusively nonviolent resistance
- **Growth**: From small student group to 80+ chapters by February 2000
- **Key campaigns**: "Gotov je" (He's Finished!) and "Vreme je!" (It's Time!)

Otpor helped unite fractious opposition parties into the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), securing agreement on single candidate Vojislav Kostunica.

### The September 2000 Election

- **Date**: September 24, 2000
- **Turnout**: 80%
- **Results**: Kostunica 50.24%, Milosevic 37.15%
- **Regime response**: Federal Election Commission declared runoff needed

### October 5 Revolution ("Bulldozer Revolution")

When results were falsified, DOS and Otpor called for general strike and mass protests:

- **October 5, 2000**: Hundreds of thousands converged on Belgrade
- Protesters stormed Parliament building, burned ballot boxes
- RTS building targeted by demonstrators
- **Milosevic resigned** the same day

Sources: [Overthrow of Milosevic - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overthrow_of_Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87), [Global Nonviolent Action Database](https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/serbians-overthrow-milosevic-bulldozer-revolution-2000)

### International Support

The opposition received significant Western assistance:
- Reported $41 million in U.S. funding
- 2.5 million stickers, 5,000 spray cans for anti-Milosevic messaging
- International Republican Institute trained 400 activists abroad, who trained 15,000 domestic election observers

## 8. Trial and Death

### Transfer to The Hague

- **April 1, 2001**: Arrested by Serbian police on domestic charges
- **June 29, 2001**: Transferred to ICTY custody in The Hague
- **February 12, 2002**: Trial opened

Milosevic was the first former head of state tried by an international criminal tribunal since Nuremberg.

### The Trial (2002-2006)

- **Charges**: 66 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes
- **Plea**: Not guilty to all charges
- **Defense**: Milosevic served as his own lawyer
- **Challenges**: Frequent delays due to Milosevic's poor health

### Death and Aftermath

- **March 11, 2006**: Found dead in detention cell at Scheveningen
- **Cause**: Heart attack (confirmed by Dutch and Tribunal investigations)
- **Trial status**: Approximately three weeks from conclusion
- **March 14, 2006**: Proceedings formally terminated

Milosevic had recently been denied permission to seek treatment at a Russian cardiology clinic, fueling conspiracy theories about his death.

## 9. Legacy

### Impact on Serbian Society

- Entrenched nationalist politics across the political spectrum
- Delayed democratization and EU integration
- Unresolved territorial questions (Kosovo independence)
- Economic devastation requiring decades of recovery
- Emigration of educated population

### Regional Trauma

The Yugoslav Wars caused:
- 130,000-140,000 deaths
- 4.4 million refugees and displaced persons
- First European genocide since WWII
- Destruction of multiethnic communities
- Intergenerational trauma across the region

### Transitional Justice

- **ICTY legacy**: 161 individuals indicted; demonstrated that heads of state lack immunity
- **Limitations**: No truth commission established; key figures (Milosevic, Arkan) died before verdicts
- **Ongoing debates**: Serbian state has yet to fully reckon with wartime actions; nationalist historiography remains influential

## 10. Scholarly Debates

### Primordialism vs. Instrumentalism

**Primordialist view**: Conflicts resulted from "ancient hatreds" inherent to Balkan ethnic groups; violence was inevitable given the region's history.

**Critiques**:
- Cannot explain periods of peace and coexistence
- Ignores high intermarriage rates before the wars
- Yugoslavia was considered the most liberal communist state

**Instrumentalist view**: Nationalism was manufactured by elites like Milosevic who manipulated ethnic identity for political gain.

**Critiques**:
- Does not explain the preconditions enabling such manipulation
- Underestimates role of genuine popular sentiment

**Constructivist synthesis**: The fall of Yugoslavia had multiple causes - Tito's federalization created nationalist elites; economic crisis translated socio-economic grievances into nationalist discourse; security fears and manipulation by elites combined to produce violence.

> Susan Woodward: "The conflict is not a result of historical animosities...it is the result of the politics of transforming a socialist society to a market economy and democracy."

### International Intervention

**Questions of legitimacy**:
- NATO intervention occurred without UN Security Council authorization
- Debate between humanitarian necessity and violation of sovereignty
- Precedent-setting implications for future interventions

**Supporting arguments**:
- Customary international law permits force for overwhelming humanitarian necessity
- Post-war UN administration (UNMIK) arguably ratified action post festum

**Critical arguments**:
- Violated UN Charter Article 2(4) prohibition on use of force
- Serbia had not attacked any NATO member
- Set dangerous precedent for unilateral intervention

> UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan: "There are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace," but "under the Charter the Security Council has primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security."

### International Criminal Justice

**Achievements of ICTY**:
- First international war crimes tribunal since Nuremberg/Tokyo
- Established individual criminal responsibility for heads of state
- Created extensive documentary record of the conflicts
- Convicted key perpetrators (Karadzic, Mladic)

**Limitations**:
- Milosevic died before verdict
- Many perpetrators never prosecuted
- Limited impact on nationalist narratives within Serbia
- Questions about whether justice contributed to reconciliation

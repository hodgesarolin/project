# Saparmurat Niyazov: Turkmenbashi and the Sultanistic Regime of Turkmenistan (1985-2006)

## Overview

Saparmurat Atayevich Niyazov (February 19, 1940 - December 21, 2006) was a Turkmen politician who ruled Turkmenistan from 1985 until his death, first as Communist Party leader and then as the independent nation's president. He created one of the most extreme personality cults in modern history, declaring himself "Turkmenbashi" (Father of All Turkmen) and being proclaimed President for Life in 1999. His regime combined Soviet-style totalitarian control with highly personalist, sultanistic characteristics, making Turkmenistan one of the world's most isolated and repressive states.

**Key characteristics of the Niyazov regime:**
- Extreme personality cult rivaling North Korea's Kim dynasty
- Complete elimination of political opposition
- Total state control over media and information
- Bizarre personal decrees affecting daily life
- Mandatory study of his spiritual text, the *Ruhnama*
- Gas-funded subsidies masking widespread poverty
- International isolation approaching that of North Korea

## 1. Pre-Conditions: Soviet Turkmenistan and Early Life

### Tragic Origins: The Orphan of Ashgabat

Niyazov was born on February 19, 1940, in Ashgabat, the capital of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic. His early life was marked by profound tragedy that would later shape his personality cult:

- **Father's death (1942)**: According to his autobiography, his father Atamyrat, a rural schoolteacher, was conscripted during World War II and killed in the Battle of the Caucasus, though credible evidence for this claim is limited [^1]
- **The 1948 Ashgabat Earthquake**: When Niyazov was eight years old, a devastating magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck Ashgabat on October 5-6, 1948, killing an estimated 110,000 people. His mother and two brothers perished in the disaster [^2]
- **Orphanage years**: The young Saparmurat grew up in a Soviet orphanage before being placed in the custody of a distant relative [^3]

The psychological impact of these early losses would later manifest in unusual ways during his presidency, including:
- The Earthquake Monument in Ashgabat depicting a woman lifting a golden baby (symbolizing Niyazov) from cracking ground
- Naming the year 2003 after his father and 2004 after his mother
- Renaming the Turkmen word for bread to his late mother's name, "Gurbansoltan" [^4]

> "At his core, Niyazov was deeply fearful. Born in 1940, he had the insecurity that came from early abandonment." - Eurasianet memoir [^5]

### Education and Communist Party Career

**Education:**
- 1967: Graduated from the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute with a degree in engineering
- Returned to Turkmen SSR to work at a power plant in Buzmeyin (Bezmein), near Ashgabat [^6]

**Rise through the Communist Party:**
- 1962: Joined the Communist Party of Turkmenistan, beginning his political career
- Rose through party ranks, becoming First Secretary of the Ashgabat City Committee
- His advancement was aided by his orphan status - when predecessor Muhammetnazar Gapurov was removed amid nepotism scandals, Niyazov's lack of family connections made him an attractive choice [^7]

**Soviet-era characteristics:**
- The Turkmen Communist Party under Niyazov had a reputation as one of the most hardline and unreformed party organizations in the Soviet Union
- He remained aloof from Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika reforms, even calling them "pseudo-reform" [^8]

---

## 2. Rise to Power (1985-1999)

### Appointment as First Secretary (1985)

On December 21, 1985, Niyazov was appointed First Secretary of the Communist Party of Turkmenistan by the CPSU Politburo. Key factors:

- **Predecessor's removal**: Muhammetnazar Gapurov, who had led since 1969, was removed following a cotton-related scandal amid broader Soviet scrutiny of Central Asian leaders [^9]
- **Gorbachev's choice**: Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev selected Niyazov to head the Turkmen party and carry out a cleanup campaign against corruption and mismanagement [^10]
- **De facto control**: The appointment gave Niyazov control over the Turkmen SSR's political, economic, and security apparatus

### Transition Through Soviet Collapse

**Key dates:**
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| January 13, 1990 | Became Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR (equivalent to president) |
| October 1990 | Won first executive presidential election with 98.3% of the vote |
| August 1991 | Supported the Soviet coup attempt against Gorbachev |
| October 27, 1991 | Turkmen Supreme Soviet declared independence; appointed Niyazov as first president |
| June 1992 | Won uncontested presidential election (the last to be held) |

> "Niyazov supported the Soviet coup attempt of 1991. However, after the coup collapsed, he set about separating Turkmenistan from the dying Soviet Union." - Wikipedia [^11]

### Consolidation of Power (1992-1999)

**1993: Adoption of "Turkmenbashi" title**
- Formally adopted the name Turkmenbashi ("Head of All Turkmen" or "Father of All Turkmen") to stress his role as leader and arbiter of all Turkmen people [^12]

**1994: First term extension**
- A plebiscite extended Niyazov's term to 2002 to oversee a 10-year development plan
- Official results showed 99.9% voter approval [^13]

**1999: President for Life**
- On December 28, 1999, the Mejlis (parliament) unanimously voted to make Niyazov President for Life
- The parliament itself had taken office only a week earlier in elections that included only candidates hand-picked by Niyazov
- Turkmenistan became the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country to formally abandon presidential elections [^14]

---

## 3. The Personality Cult

### "Turkmenbashi": Father of All Turkmen

Niyazov established what scholars describe as "a personality cult that Stalin or Mao would have admired" [^15]. The cult manifested in virtually every aspect of Turkmen life.

### The Golden Rotating Statue

The most iconic symbol of the personality cult was the Neutrality Monument (also known as the Neutrality Arch or "The Tripod") in Ashgabat:

- **Construction**: Built in 1998 by Turkish firm Polimeks at a cost of $12 million
- **Dimensions**: 75 meters (246 ft) tall three-legged arch
- **The rotating statue**: Topped by a 12-meter (39 ft) gold-plated statue of Niyazov that rotated throughout the day to always face the sun [^16]
- **Post-Niyazov fate**: In 2010, successor Berdimuhamedow had the monument dismantled and moved to the suburbs; the statue no longer rotates [^17]

### Ubiquitous Images

Niyazov's image pervaded every aspect of public life:

- **Currency**: His portrait appeared on every single denomination of Turkmen currency. In 1999, all currency was recalled and portraits throughout the country were changed after Niyazov dyed his hair black following quadruple bypass surgery [^18]
- **Buildings**: Statues stood in front of almost every government building
- **Media**: His golden profile was superimposed on the upper right corner of broadcasts on the two state television channels
- **Consumer goods**: His likeness appeared on vodka bottles, watches, and various products
- **Required portraits**: All state offices, school classrooms, production facilities, and hallways were required to display the Leader's portrait [^19]

### Renaming Everything

Niyazov renamed an extraordinary range of things after himself and his family:

**Geographic locations:**
- The city of Krasnovodsk became "Turkmenbashi"
- The town of Janga became "Turkmenbashi"
- Streets, airports, and a canal were renamed [^20]

**Calendar changes (2002):**
On August 10, 2002, the government adopted a law renaming all months and most days of the week:

| Month | New Name | Significance |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| January | Turkmenbashi | Niyazov's title |
| February | Baidag | "Month of the Banner" |
| March | Novruz | Spring Muslim holiday |
| April | Gurbansoltan Eje | Niyazov's mother |
| May | Makhtumkuli | Medieval Turkmen poet |
| June | Oguz | Oguz-Khan, forefather of Turkmen |
| July | Gorkut | Epic hero |
| August | Alp Arslan | Seljuk Empire founder |
| September | Ruhnama | Niyazov's book |
| October | Garashsyzlyk | Independence |
| November | Sandzhar | Last Seljuk ruler |
| December | Bitaraplyk | Neutrality |

Days of the week received abstract redesignations, such as "Main Day" and "Spirit" (Saturday was renamed "Ruhnama Day") [^21]

> According to documentary filmmaker Arto Halonen, Turkish businessman Ahmet Calik came up with the idea to rename the months while trying to expand his business in the country [^22]

**Other renamings:**
- A meteorite
- A moon crater (claimed)
- A breed of horse (Akhal-Teke renamed to Turkmenbashi breed)
- Years 2003 (father) and 2004 (mother)

These calendar changes were reversed in 2008 under Berdimuhamedow, who stated: "Names of months and days have to comply with international standards" [^23]

---

## 4. The Ruhnama: Mandatory Spiritual Guide

### Origins and Content

The *Ruhnama* ("Book of the Soul" or "Book of the Spirit") was a two-volume work written by Niyazov in 2001:

- **Stated purpose**: "Spiritual guidance of the nation" and basis for the nation's arts and literature
- **Content**: A combination of revisionist Turkmen history, moral ideals, religious norms, and fairytales
- **Goal**: To "Turkmenize" the country by creating a positive image of Turkmen people and defining "moral, family, social and religious norms for modern Turkmens" [^24]

### Mandatory Status

The *Ruhnama* was imposed throughout Turkmen society:

**Education:**
- Primary and secondary schools: 2-4 hours per week dedicated to Ruhnama study
- Universities: 4-8 hours per week
- 26 of 57 examination cards for the 2006 university entrance examination revolved around Ruhnama themes [^25]

**Employment:**
- New governmental employees were tested on the book at job interviews
- Reading was mandatory in all governmental organizations [^26]

**Daily life:**
- An exam on its teachings was required for the driving test
- Copies were placed in schools, libraries, and mosques [^27]

### Religious Claims

Niyazov elevated the *Ruhnama* to quasi-religious status:

- It was treated as "a spiritual guide on par with the Quran"
- The minaret of the Turkmenbashi Ruhy Mosque bore the inscription: "The Ruhnama is a holy book, the Koran is Allah's book"
- Imams who refused to place the Ruhnama at the same level as the Quran faced investigation and police interrogation
- In March 2006, Niyazov claimed he had "interceded with God to ensure that any student who read the book three times would automatically get into paradise" [^28]

**Giant monument**: A giant mechanical Ruhnama monument was installed in Ashgabat's Memorial Park, with pages that opened and closed automatically [^29]

### Post-Niyazov decline

After Niyazov's death, President Berdimuhamedow gradually phased out the Ruhnama. By 2013, it was no longer on the public-school curriculum [^30]

---

## 5. Bizarre Decrees

Niyazov issued an extraordinary array of personal decrees regulating behavior in all aspects of life. These decrees reflected both his autocratic control and his personal eccentricities.

### Cultural and Entertainment Bans

| Year | Decree | Justification |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 2001 | Banned opera, ballet, and circus | "Not corresponding with the national mentality" / "Incompatible with Turkmen mentality" |
| 2005 | Banned lip-syncing at all events | "Negative effect on the development of singing and musical art" |
| Various | Banned car radios | Considered "useless" |
| Various | Banned recorded music at weddings | Personal preference |
| Various | Banned video games | Not specified |
| Various | Closed philharmonic orchestras | "Decidedly un-Turkmen-like" |

> "Under Niyazov's order, lip-syncing is prohibited at all cultural events, concerts, on television and at private celebrations such as weddings." - Fox News [^31]

### Personal Appearance Restrictions

- **Beards**: Banned for men in 2004; only men older than 70 were allowed to grow beards
- **Long hair**: Banned for young men
- **Gold teeth**: Discouraged; Niyazov advised people to "chew on bones like dogs" to strengthen their teeth [^32]
- **Makeup on news presenters**: Banned to enforce a "rigid, state-approved image"

### Public Services and Infrastructure

**Healthcare:**
- 2005: Ordered closure of all hospitals outside Ashgabat and major regional towns
- 15,000 healthcare workers were sacked and replaced with untrained army conscripts
- Niyazov stated: "If people are ill, they can come to Ashgabat" [^33]

**Libraries:**
- All libraries outside the capital were closed
- Niyazov believed "the only books that most Turkmens needed to read were the Quran and his Ruhnama" [^34]

### Animals and Urban Policy

- **Dogs**: Banished from Ashgabat because of their "unappealing odour" [^35]

---

## 6. Methods of Control

### Total Information Blackout

**Media ownership and control:**
- All Turkmen newspapers, radio, and television stations were state-owned
- The state broadcasting company TMT had a total monopoly
- The state printing company Turkmenmetbugat controlled all publications
- Niyazov personally appointed editors of all media outlets
- Approval from Niyazov's office was required before newspapers could print or evening news could broadcast [^36]

**Content:**
- TMT output was "little more than a fawning adjunct to the president's personality cult"
- Every presidential activity was transmitted at length in news bulletins
- The Committee for the Preservation of State Secrets was responsible for prior censorship [^37]

**Blocking foreign information (2002):**
- July 2002: Authorities blocked delivery of Russian publications to Turkmen subscribers
- July 2002: Niyazov closed the privately owned cable system transmitting foreign satellite broadcasts
- 2005: Import and distribution of all foreign press was banned [^38]

### Restrictions on Movement

**Exit visas and travel bans:**
- Citizens required official permission to leave the country
- A decree reportedly barred 37,057 specific individuals from leaving
- Any law enforcement body could impose a travel ban
- Categories denied departure included: young men obligated to military service; relatives of those convicted in the 2002 assassination attempt [^39]

**Internal passports:**
- Internal passports and residency permits were required

### The 2002 Alleged Assassination Attempt

On November 25, 2002, Niyazov's motorcade was attacked with machine gun fire near the Olympic stadium in Ashgabat:

**Official narrative:**
- Niyazov identified four exiled former officials as organizers: Boris Shikhmuradov (former Foreign Minister), Saparmurat Yklimov (former deputy agriculture minister), Khudaiberdy Orazov (former Central Bank head), and Nurmuhammed Khanamov (former ambassador to Turkey) [^44]

**The crackdown:**
- 46 people were eventually accused
- Over 300 people were detained; the fate of most remains unknown
- Widespread reports of torture and abuse during investigations

- Human Rights Watch received unconfirmed reports that numerous defendants died in detention
- The fate of approximately 50 prisoners convicted in the 2002 case remains unknown, with whereabouts not disclosed even to families [^47]

---

## 7. Economic Policy

### Natural Gas Wealth

Turkmenistan possesses enormous energy resources:
- Estimated to have the world's fifth-largest natural gas reserves
- Natural gas remains the country's biggest resource
- Niyazov used hydrocarbon wealth to finance his system of control [^48]

### The Free Utilities System

In 1993, Niyazov introduced one of the world's most generous subsidy systems:

**Free provisions included:**
- Electricity
- Natural gas
- Water
- Salt
- Initially extended for ten years, then to 2030 [^49]

**Impact:**
- Households virtually never switched off gas flows
- Domestic overconsumption: Turkmenistan consumed ~36.7% of natural gas produced (very high for 5.2 million people)
- Subsidies consumed more than 22% of GDP [^50]

**Post-Niyazov changes:**
- Berdimuhamedow maintained subsidies but set caps: 120 liters free gasoline/month; 35 kWh electricity/person/month; 600 cubic meters gas/person/year
- Free utilities fully ended in 2019 amid falling energy prices and Russia's decision to stop purchasing Turkmen gas [^51]

### Economic Mismanagement

Despite vast resources, the economy suffered under Niyazov:

**Economic decline:**
- 1995: Economy shrank 25%
- 1996: Economy shrank 15% (despite projections of 17% growth); inflation reached 150%
- 1997: GDP was 65% of 1990 level [^52]

**Characteristics:**
- Central planning and state control pervaded the system
- Niyazov consistently rejected market reform programs
- He called entrepreneurial activity "rent-seeking situations"
- Gave out free food in Ashgabat streets [^53]

**Kleptocracy:**
- As of 2003, Niyazov was believed to have $1.4-2 billion in foreign accounts
- A 2006 Global Witness report alleged that "a significant portion of revenue never finds its way into state coffers"
- An estimated 75% of state spending took place off-budget [^54]

### Poverty Despite Resources

- Nearly 60% of the population lived in poverty (World Bank estimate)
- Grandiose construction in Ashgabat masked deep poverty throughout the country
- No transparency about where proceeds from lucrative international energy contracts went [^55]

---

## 8. International Isolation

### "The North Korea of Central Asia"

Turkmenistan under Niyazov became one of the world's most closed societies:

**Freedom House rankings:**
- Ranked among the "worst of the worst" for political freedoms and civil liberties
- Scored only 2 of 100 possible points - lower than North Korea [^56]

**Reporters Without Borders:**
- Turkmenistan consistently occupied one of the last three spots in the Press Freedom Index since its inception in 2006
- Total absence of media freedom
- Foreign media had almost no access to the country [^57]

### Internet Restrictions

Control over information extended to the digital realm:

- Government controlled the main internet access gateway through the Ministry of National Security
- YouTube, Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and VPNs were blocked
- Lowest internet penetration in Central Asia: approximately 38% of population
- One of the world's most expensive mobile internet systems
- One of the world's slowest average download speeds
- Only about 2.8% of the population (~180,400 people) used social media [^58]

### Journalist persecution

- Self-censorship was ubiquitous
- Only journalists writing under pseudonyms for overseas publications were safe
- RFE/RL correspondent was taken from home, brutally beaten, and threatened with death
- Journalist Ogulsapar Myradowa apparently tortured to death in state detention (September 2006) [^59]

### Diplomatic isolation

After the 2002 assassination attempt:
- Niyazov expelled the Uzbekistan Embassy, claiming President Karimov had connections to the plot
- Refused independent observers at trials
- Rejected mandatory OSCE fact-finding mission
- Denied International Committee of the Red Cross access to prisons [^60]

---

## 9. Death and Succession (December 2006)

### Niyazov's Death

On December 21, 2006, Turkmen state television announced that President Niyazov had died of a sudden heart attack:

- **Time of death**: Approximately 01:10 local time
- **Location**: Turkmenbashi Palace residence
- **Age**: 66 years old
- **Health history**: One month prior, Niyazov had publicly acknowledged taking heart medication for an unidentified cardiac condition; he had undergone quadruple bypass surgery in Germany in 1997 [^61]

### The Constitutional Crisis

Niyazov named no successor, creating an immediate power struggle:

**Constitutional provisions:**
- Under the Constitution, Owezgeldi Atayew, Chairman of the Assembly, should have assumed the presidency [^62]

**What actually happened:**
- On the day of Niyazov's death, Atayew was arrested and charged with abuse of power and human rights violations
- Security forces led by Defense Minister Agageldy Mamedgeldyev established a Security Council
- Deputy Prime Minister Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow was named acting president on December 21, 2006 [^63]

**Constitutional manipulation:**
- Article 60 prohibited the acting president from standing for election
- On December 24, 2006, the People's Council voted to remove this provision
- This made Berdimuhamedow eligible for the February 2007 election [^64]

### Berdimuhamedow: The Dentist-President

**Background:**
- 1979: Graduated from dentistry faculty of Turkmen State Medical Institute
- Completed PhD in Medical Sciences in Moscow
- 1980: Began work as a dentist
- 1995: Became head of the dentistry center at Ministry of Health
- Became Niyazov's personal dentist
- 1997: Appointed Minister of Health
- 2001: Appointed Deputy Chairman of Cabinet of Ministers [^65]

**Election:**
- February 11, 2007: Won presidential election with 89% of the vote
- Faced no meaningful opposition
- Genuine regime opponents were excluded from the carefully choreographed process [^66]

### Post-Niyazov Changes

Berdimuhamedow made some reforms while maintaining authoritarianism:

**Reversals:**
- 2008: Restored original names of months and days
- Removed reference to Niyazov from National Anthem (replaced with "the people")
- 2010: Dismantled and relocated the golden rotating statue
- 2013: Ruhnama removed from school curriculum
- Replaced Niyazov's image on most currency denominations [^67]

**Continuities:**
- Authoritarian system remained firmly in place
- Berdimuhamedow developed his own personality cult
- In 2022, power was passed to his son Serdar Berdimuhamedow, transforming the regime into a dynasty [^68]

---

## 10. Scholarly Debates

### Sultanistic Regime Theory

Turkmenistan under Niyazov is a key case study in the scholarly literature on sultanistic regimes, a concept developed by political scientists Juan Linz and H.E. Chehabi based on Max Weber's concept of sultanistic domination.

**Key theoretical points:**

**Weber's definition:**
Sultanistic domination is characterized by extreme personal presence of the ruler in all elements of governance, with power based on personal favor rather than ideology or law [^69]

**Linz and Stepan's analysis:**
> "The essential reality in a sultanistic regime is that all individuals, groups and institutions are permanently subject to the unpredictable and despotic intervention of the sultan, and thus all pluralism is precarious." [^70]

**Distinguishing features:**
- Absence of true ideology (unlike totalitarian regimes)
- Extreme personalization of power
- Lack of institutionalization
- The sultan may adopt a ruling ideology but is never bound by any rules or ideology, even his own [^71]

### Application to Turkmenistan

Academic research has extensively analyzed the Niyazov regime through this theoretical lens:

**Anne Mills' doctoral thesis (White Rose eTheses):**
- Investigated why extreme personal rule arose and endured in Turkmenistan
- Found that structural legacies of pre-Soviet and Soviet periods, allied with favorable strategic context, enabled Niyazov to secure power
- Identified a "disciplinary-symbolic" nexus of control techniques, with personality cult as essential component
- Concluded that while Linz and Chehabi's insights remain valid, they "require careful revision and refinement" [^72]

**Scholarly debates:**
- Some scholars argue Turkmenistan cannot be classified as fully totalitarian (following Linz 2000)
- Others characterize it as "increasingly neo-sultanist"
- Debate continues over whether it constitutes a pure sultanistic regime or a hybrid form [^73]

### Comparisons with Other Regimes

**North Korea:**
- Most frequent comparison in academic and political discourse
- Both feature extreme personality cults
- Comparative study: Somdeep Sen's "Sustaining Totalitarian Cult Leaderships: Turkmenistan and North Korea" critically analyzes both Kim Il Sung and Niyazov [^74]

**Stalinist parallels:**
- Niyazov described as creating a "Stalinistic personality cult"
- RFE/RL characterized the country as being in "neo-Stalinist stupor"
- Combined "Stalinist control with surreal autocracy" [^75]

**Central Asian context:**
- Scholars identify a dichotomy between "hard" authoritarianism (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan) and "soft" authoritarianism (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan)
- Turkmenistan labeled as "the most authoritarian and closed political regime in the region" [^76]

### Key Academic Sources

Essential scholarly works on Turkmenistan's authoritarianism:

1. **Linz, Juan J. and H.E. Chehabi**, eds. *Sultanistic Regimes* (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998)
2. **Al-Bassam, Kareem**. "The Evolution of Authoritarianism in Turkmenistan" - *Demokratizatsiya* [^77]
3. **Carnegie Endowment for International Peace**. "Turkmenistan at Twenty-Five: The High Price of Authoritarianism" (2017)
4. **International Crisis Group**. "Turkmenistan after Niyazov" (2007)

**Transitions scholarship:**
Chehabi and Linz argue that sultanistic regimes do not offer favorable transitions to democracy, regardless of what the person in power says. The Turkmenistan case, where Berdimuhamedow maintained authoritarianism and eventually established a dynasty, appears to confirm this thesis [^78]

---

## Regional Comparisons

### Related Regimes

Niyazov's Turkmenistan shares characteristics with other post-Soviet and post-Cold War authoritarian regimes:

- [[north-korea-kim-dynasty]] - Most comparable personality cult; similar levels of isolation and information control
- [[uzbekistan-karimov]] - Fellow Central Asian "hard" authoritarian; similar repression of opposition
- [[kazakhstan-nazarbayev]] - Post-Soviet personalist rule, though "softer" authoritarianism

### Distinctive Features

What made Niyazov's regime particularly unusual:

1. **Extremity of personality cult**: Surpassed most other contemporary cults
2. **Bizarre personal decrees**: The range and absurdity were unmatched
3. **Ideological vacuity**: Unlike ideological regimes, based purely on personal whim
4. **Economic generosity amid repression**: Free utilities alongside total political control
5. **Self-succession failure**: Unlike North Korea, could not establish a dynasty (until successor did)

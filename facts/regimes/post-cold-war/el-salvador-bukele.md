# El Salvador Under Nayib Bukele (2019-Present)

## Executive Summary

Nayib Bukele's presidency in El Salvador represents one of the most significant cases of democratic backsliding in contemporary Latin America. Rising to power as an anti-establishment outsider in 2019, Bukele has consolidated near-absolute control through a combination of constitutional manipulation, judicial capture, and an aggressive gang crackdown that has resulted in the world's highest incarceration rate. Despite widespread international condemnation of human rights abuses and constitutional violations, Bukele maintains approval ratings around 90%, making El Salvador a critical case study in what scholars term "popular authoritarianism" or "millennial authoritarianism."

---

## I. Pre-Conditions: The Crisis That Enabled Bukele's Rise

### A. The Gang Violence Crisis

El Salvador's gang crisis emerged from the ashes of its 12-year civil war (1980-1992), which pitted the US-backed right-wing government against Cuban and Soviet-supported leftist guerrillas. [Source: [Harvard International Review](https://hir.harvard.edu/bukeles-gang-violence-crackdown-el-salvador/)]

**Origins of MS-13 and Barrio 18:**
- Both gangs originated in Los Angeles among Salvadoran refugees
- Mass deportations in the 1990s brought gang culture to El Salvador
- By 2004: 10,000-39,000 gang members in El Salvador
- By 2012: approximately 60,000 gang members [Source: [Wikipedia - Salvadoran Gang Crackdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_gang_crackdown)]

**Scale of Violence:**
- By 2016, gangs had presence in 247 of 262 municipalities
- 2015 homicide rate: 105 per 100,000 (highest in the world, excluding war zones)
- El Salvador became known as the "murder capital of the world"
- Average of one killing per hour by August 2015 [Source: [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/30/el-salvador-gang-violence-ms13-nation-held-hostage-photography/)]

**Failed Policy Responses:**
- *Mano Dura* (2003) and *Super Mano Dura* (2004): ARENA's iron-fist policies paradoxically strengthened gangs
- 2012 Gang Truce: Brokered by government, church, and community groups; initially reduced homicides from 70 to 40 per 100,000
- Truce collapse (2014): Homicides spiked to 105 per 100,000 by 2015
- 2016: Legislature outlawed gang negotiations [Source: [InSight Crime](https://insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/mara-salvatrucha-ms-13-profile/)]

**Impact on Daily Life:**
- Extortion fees for entering/leaving gang territories
- Businesses forced to pay regular extortion
- Unwritten rule: "see, hear, and be quiet" enforced by violence
- Poverty and lack of opportunities drove youth gang recruitment [Source: [UK Government Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/el-salvador-country-policy-and-information-notes/country-policy-and-information-note-fear-of-gangs-el-salvador-december-2025-accessible)]

### B. Corrupt Two-Party System

The Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) dominated Salvadoran politics from 1994 to 2019, failing to address corruption, inequality, and organized crime. [Source: [Journal of Democracy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/latin-america-erupts-millennial-authoritarianism-in-el-salvador/)]

**Presidential Corruption:**
| President | Party | Corruption Allegation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|

**Spread of "Bukeleism":**
- Nuevas Ideas opened offices in Guatemala and Honduras
- Pro-Bukele marches in Guatemala and Honduras
- Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Chile: Candidates promise Bukele-style approaches [Source: [Americas Quarterly - Admirers](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/nayib-bukeles-growing-list-of-latin-american-admirers/)]

**Limitations on Replicability:**
- El Salvador's small size (6.5 million) facilitates comprehensive action
- Different countries face different security challenges (narco vs. gang violence)
- Honduras state of exception has not achieved comparable results
- High democratic and human rights costs [Source: [American Affairs Journal](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2024/05/the-bukele-model-and-the-future-of-el-salvador/)]

## X. Scholarly Debates

### A. Regime Classification

**"Competitive Authoritarianism" (Journal of Democracy):**
- Opposition candidates free to compete
- Most citizens free to vote
- Votes mostly counted
- BUT: Core democratic rules systematically violated
- State resources abused to disadvantage opposition
- Electoral tribunal, courts, referees captured [Source: [Journal of Democracy - Most Popular Dictator](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/elections/how-the-worlds-most-popular-dictator-wins/)]

**"Millennial Authoritarianism":**
- Combines traditional populist appeals with classic autocratic behavior
- Modern personal brand built on social media
- Youthful, tech-savvy image
- Echoes: Fujimori (Peru), Chavez (Venezuela), Correa (Ecuador) [Source: [Journal of Democracy - Millennial Authoritarianism](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/latin-america-erupts-millennial-authoritarianism-in-el-salvador/)]

### B. The Security-Rights Tradeoff Debate

**The "False Tradeoff" Argument (Human Rights Foundation):**
> "This is a tradeoff that is so often presented in so many different contexts... that you have to give up some amount of freedom, civil liberties, human rights in order to have safety."

Critics argue:
- Democratic systems offer long-term stability and corrective mechanisms
- Authoritarian measures may solve immediate problems but create new vulnerabilities
- State violence replacing gang violence is not "success" [Source: [HRF](https://hrf.org/latest/el-salvador-the-false-tradeoffs-between-security-and-democracy/)]

**The "Popular Will" Argument:**
- 90%+ approval suggests genuine mandate
- Citizens experienced tangible security improvements
- Democratic governments failed for 30 years
- Voters made informed choice accepting tradeoffs [Source: [Stanford FSI](https://fsi.stanford.edu/news/fragility-and-appeal-authoritarianism-el-salvador)]

### C. Sustainability Questions

**Magaloni & Diaz-Cayeros (Stanford):**
> "The Salvadoran state's apparent strength sits atop an extremely fragile foundation: Bukele's crime policy has successfully improved physical security for some while failing to deliver social and economic gains."

Predictions:
- Alternation between popularity, repression, external challenges
- Security gains may not translate to economic development
- Fragility masked by current popularity [Source: [Stanford FSI](https://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/news/fragility-and-appeal-authoritarianism-el-salvador)]

### D. Democratic Backsliding Assessment

**International IDEA (2025):**
- El Salvador experiencing fastest rate of democratic backsliding in Latin America

**Key Indicators:**
- Judicial independence: Eliminated
- Term limits: Abolished
- Legislative checks: One-party supermajority
- Press freedom: Collapsed
- Civil liberties: Suspended for 3+ years [Source: [Journal of Democracy - Backsliding](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/misunderstanding-democratic-backsliding/)]

## XI. Comparative Analysis

### Historical Parallels

| Regime | Similarity | Difference |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| [[peru-fujimori]] | Self-coup, court packing, anti-crime mandate | Bukele maintains higher sustained popularity |
| [[venezuela-chavez]] | Populist outsider, constitutional manipulation | Bukele's economic policy more conventional |
| [[philippines-marcos]] | State of emergency, martial law, human rights abuses | Bukele uses democratic facade more effectively |
| [[guatemala-rios-montt]] | Mass detention, military role, state violence | Bukele operates in peacetime, targets criminals |
| [[hungary-orban]] | Illiberal democracy, media control, EU tensions | Bukele's crackdown more violent and visible |

### Unique Features of Bukele Model

1. **Genuine Mass Approval:** Unlike most authoritarians, approval ratings independently verified at 85-90%+
2. **Social Media Native:** First "millennial authoritarian" - governance through Twitter
3. **Transparent Authoritarianism:** Self-describes as "world's coolest dictator"
4. **Export Model:** Actively spreading approach to neighboring countries
5. **Security Delivery:** Actually achieved dramatic crime reduction (unlike many strongmen)

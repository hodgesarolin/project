# Turkey Under Recep Tayyip Erdogan (2003-Present)

## Overview

Recep Tayyip Erdogan has governed Turkey since 2003, first as Prime Minister (2003-2014) and then as President (2014-present). His tenure represents one of the most significant political transformations in Turkish history: from initial democratic reforms and EU-oriented policies to the construction of what scholars classify as a competitive authoritarian regime. Turkey's trajectory illustrates the modern pattern of democratic backsliding through executive aggrandizement rather than traditional coup mechanisms.

---

## 1. Pre-Conditions

### 1.1 Turkish Secularism (Kemalism)

Turkey's political landscape before Erdogan was shaped by Kemalism, the ideology of founding president Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, which established six principles: Republicanism, Populism, Nationalism, Laicism (secularism), Statism, and Reformism. [Kemalism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemalism)

The Turkish military positioned itself as the guardian of Kemalist principles, particularly secularism. The constitutions of 1924, 1961, and 1982 formally specified the army's role in protecting Turkey against both internal and external threats. [Modern Turkey's History of Military Coups - ADST](https://adst.org/2016/07/modern-turkeys-history-military-coups/)

### 1.2 History of Military Coups

The Turkish military intervened directly in politics four times:

| Year | Type | Target | Outcome |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 1960 | Full coup | Democrat Party (Adnan Menderes) | Military rule until 1961; Menderes executed |
| 1971 | Memorandum coup | Suleyman Demirel government | PM forced to resign |
| 1980 | Full coup | Civilian government | Most violent; military rule until 1983 |
| 1997 | "Post-modern" coup | Necmettin Erbakan (Islamist PM) | Government forced out by military ultimatum |

The 1997 intervention was particularly significant as it targeted political Islam. The military authorities forced Islamist Prime Minister Erbakan to resign, but paradoxically, this would lead political Islam to return "more powerfully without needing a coalition partner." [Turkey's Cyclical Coups - Dissent Magazine](https://dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/turkey-coup-countercoup-akp-erdogan-gulenist-purges/)

### 1.3 The 2001 Economic Crisis

The 2001 Turkish economic crisis created the political opening for Erdogan's rise:

- **Trigger**: On February 19, 2001, PM Bulent Ecevit announced a political crisis that ignited an economic crisis. Overnight interest rates jumped to 6,200%. [2001 Turkish Economic Crisis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Turkish_economic_crisis)
- **Capital flight**: Foreign investors withdrew over $70 billion between 2000-2001. [American Diplomacy - CPR for the Turkish Economy](https://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2024/02/cpr-for-the-turkish-economy-the-2001-financial-crisis-and-its-aftermath/)
- **IMF intervention**: The IMF provided $16 billion in loans requiring structural reforms in banking, fiscal consolidation, and economic governance.
- **Political consequences**: The crisis brought deep political change, ending the "Kemalist heritage of governance" after 75 years and paving the way for the AKP's electoral victory. [European Commission - Growth and Economic Crises in Turkey](https://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/pages/publication16004_en.pdf)

## 2. Rise to Power

### 2.1 AKP Founding (2001)

Erdogan established the Justice and Development Party (AKP, or AK Parti) on August 14, 2001. The party emerged from the reformist faction of the banned Virtue Party, including Abdullah Gul and Bulent Arinc, combined with former members of the Motherland Party. [Justice and Development Party - Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Justice-and-Development-Party-political-party-Turkey)

The name "AK Parti" was deliberate: "ak" means "white" or "clean" in Turkish, positioning the party against corruption. Unlike its Islamist predecessors, the AKP emphasized it was not an Islamist party but focused on democratization. [Justice and Development Party - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey))

### 2.2 The 2002 Election Victory

The AKP won the November 3, 2002 general elections with 34.28% of the vote, gaining a parliamentary majority due to Turkey's 10% electoral threshold eliminating smaller parties. [AKP - Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/akp-justice-and-development-party)

Erdogan himself was legally barred from parliament due to a 1998 conviction for inciting religious hatred (he had recited a poem comparing mosques to barracks and minarets to bayonets). Abdullah Gul initially became PM. After the AKP-controlled parliament amended the constitution, Erdogan won a by-election and became Prime Minister in March 2003. [Recep Tayyip Erdogan - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan)

### 2.3 Initial EU-Oriented Reforms (2002-2007)

The early AKP years saw genuine democratic progress:

- **EU accession negotiations** opened in 2005
- **Constitutional amendments** expanding civil liberties
- **Military reforms** reducing the armed forces' political role
- **Economic stabilization** following IMF program requirements
- **Minority rights** improvements for Kurds and other groups

The reforms continued those initiated by Economy Minister Kemal Dervis after the 2001 crisis, producing strong economic growth. [OSW - Turkey's Economy: A Story of Success](https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2013-11-06/turkeys-economy-a-story-success-uncertain-future)

---

## 3. Methods of Control

### 3.1 The Gulenist Alliance (2007-2013)

A tactical alliance formed between the AKP and the movement of Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen. The 2007 military "e-memorandum" opposing Abdullah Gul's presidential candidacy brought the two groups closer, fearing coordinated military action against both. [The Big Split - Turkey Analyst](https://www.turkeyanalyst.org/publications/turkey-analyst-articles/item/296-the-big-split-the-differences-that-led-erdogan-and-the-gulen-movement-to-part-ways.html)

**The Ergenekon and Sledgehammer Trials (2007-2013)**

The alliance launched prosecutions against the military establishment:

- **Ergenekon trials** (2007-2013): 275 people convicted, including senior military officers, journalists, lawyers, and academics, allegedly involved in a "deep state" conspiracy. [Ergenekon - Middle East Eye](https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/ergenekon-trials-turkey-gulen)
- **Sledgehammer (Balyoz) trials** (2010): 331 military personnel convicted of plotting a coup.
- **Evidence controversies**: Forensic analysis showed key documents were created using Microsoft Office 2007 beta (unavailable until 2006), suggesting fabrication. Erdogan later admitted: "We were all victims of a coup attempt... The documents presented to us turned out to be fake." [ESI - Ergenekon and Sledgehammer](https://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_turkey_tpq_vol10_no1_Dani%20Rodrik.pdf)

### 3.2 The Gulenist Purge (2013-Present)

The alliance collapsed after the December 2013 corruption scandal, with Erdogan accusing Gulenists of orchestrating a "judicial coup." Following the 2016 coup attempt, blamed on Gulenists, massive purges ensued:

- **160,000+ detained** overall
- **150,000+ civil servants** dismissed by emergency decree
- **4,145 judges and prosecutors** removed
- **20,571 military personnel** dismissed
- **34,000+ teachers** dismissed

[Purges in Turkey - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purges_in_Turkey_following_the_2016_Turkish_coup_attempt); [Stockholm Center for Freedom](https://stockholmcf.org/turkey-has-arrested-over-113000-since-2016-coup-attempt-as-crackdown-on-gulen-movement-continues/)

### 3.3 Judiciary Capture

After a decade-long campaign, Erdogan's government gained full control of the Turkish judiciary:

**Key mechanisms:**
- **2014 HSYK takeover**: Legislative amendments (Law No. 6524) reasserted ministerial control over the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors, despite the Constitutional Court finding them unconstitutional. [ICJ - Turkey: The Judicial System in Peril](https://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Turkey-Judiciary-in-Peril-Publications-Reports-Fact-Findings-Mission-Reports-2016-ENG.pdf)
- **Post-coup purges (2016)**: 4,145 judges and prosecutors dismissed, including 2 Constitutional Court judges, 140 Supreme Court of Appeals judges, and 48 Council of State judges.
- **2017 constitutional changes**: The president can now appoint 5 of 13 HSK members, plus effectively 6 (including the justice minister he appoints). Parliament (where AKP holds majority) appoints the rest. [Nordic Monitor - Turkey's Judiciary](https://nordicmonitor.com/2024/04/turkeys-judiciary-has-become-a-tool-of-tyranny-under-erdogans-rule/)
- **Constitutional Court capture**: 12 of 15 Constitutional Court members are appointed by the president. In 2021, Erdogan appointed Irfan Fidan, prosecutor of many politically-charged cases, representing a "final death blow" to judicial independence. [Verfassungsblog - Death Blow to TCC](https://verfassungsblog.de/death-blow-tcc/)

### 3.4 Media Takeover

Turkey systematically captured independent media:

**Major seizures and sales:**
- **Zaman newspaper (2016)**: Turkey's largest daily (650,000 circulation), seized by government trustees. Within days, it became pro-government, with all archived content deleted. [Zaman - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaman_(newspaper))
- **Dogan Media Group (2018)**: Turkey's largest media conglomerate sold to pro-government Demiroren Group after facing $2.5 billion in tax fines in 2009. [RSF - Dogan Media Group Sale](https://rsf.org/en/do%C4%9Fan-media-group-sale-completes-government-control-turkish-media)
- **Post-coup closures (2016)**: 150+ media organizations shut down; 160 journalists jailed. [Columbia Journalism Review - What Remains of the Turkish Press](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/turkish-press.php)

**Current media landscape:**
- 9 of 10 most-watched TV channels owned by pro-government businessmen
- 9 of 10 most-read national dailies pro-government
- 80%+ of Turkish media landscape affiliated with government [RSF - Turkey Press Freedom in Figures](https://rsf.org/en/turkey-press-freedom-figures)

### 3.5 The 2017 Constitutional Referendum

On April 16, 2017, a constitutional referendum transformed Turkey from a parliamentary to presidential system:

**Results:**
- Yes: 51.4%
- No: 48.6%
- Turnout: 85% (49.7 million votes)

[2017 Turkish Constitutional Referendum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Turkish_constitutional_referendum)

**Key changes:**
- Prime Minister office abolished
- President gained authority to issue statutory decrees, prepare budgets, declare states of emergency, and call early elections
- Parliamentary seats increased from 550 to 600
- President given more HSYK/HSK appointment power

**Controversies:**
- Held under state of emergency after 2016 coup attempt
- Supreme Electoral Council (YSK) unprecedentedly allowed unstamped ballots
- OSCE monitors said vote "did not meet international standards"
- Both Istanbul and Ankara voted No

## 4. Turning Points

### 4.1 Gezi Park Protests (May-June 2013)

**Trigger**: Plans to demolish Gezi Park, one of Istanbul's last green spaces, for a shopping mall built as Ottoman barracks replica. On May 30, police violently dispersed environmentalist protesters. [Gezi Park Protests - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezi_Park_protests)

**Escalation**: Within days, tens of thousands protested nationwide against perceived government arrogance and police brutality. The protests became about more than the park: authoritarianism, secularism, and civil liberties.

**Government response**: Erdogan refused to back down, calling protesters "terrorists." Police used tear gas, water cannons, and plastic bullets against peaceful demonstrators. [Amnesty International - Gezi Park Protests](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur44/022/2013/en/)

**Casualties:**
- 22 deaths (estimated)
- 8,163+ injuries (63 serious/critical)
- Notable deaths included 14-year-old Berkin Elvan, struck by a tear gas canister while buying bread

[Casualties of Gezi Park Protests - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Gezi_Park_protests)

**Aftermath**: Philanthropist Osman Kavala was imprisoned (later sentenced to life) for allegedly trying to overthrow the government. Large-scale protests have been largely absent since.

### 4.2 The December 2013 Corruption Scandal

**December 17, 2013**: Police raided homes of AKP-connected officials, confiscating $17.5 million in cash:
- $4.5 million at the home of Halkbank director Suleyman Aslan
- $750,000 at the home of Interior Minister's son
- 52 detained, all connected to the AKP

[2013 Corruption Scandal in Turkey - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_corruption_scandal_in_Turkey)

**December 25**: A second investigation reached Erdogan's son Bilal. Leaked recordings allegedly captured Erdogan instructing Bilal to hide tens of millions of dollars (Erdogan claimed recordings were "montage"). [Foreign Policy - Turkey's Mother of All Corruption Scandals](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/01/06/why-turkeys-mother-of-all-corruption-scandals-refuses-to-go-away/)

**Ministerial resignations:**
- Muammer Guler (Interior Minister)
- Zafer Caglayan (Economy Minister)
- Erdogan Bayraktar (Environment Minister) - called for Erdogan to resign, claiming he "did everything with the PM's approval"
- Egemen Bagis (EU Affairs Minister) - removed in cabinet reshuffle

**Government response**: Erdogan declared it a "judicial coup" by Gulenists. 700+ police chiefs and dozens of prosecutors were dismissed. The investigation was closed. In 2021, former minister Bayraktar confirmed the evidence against him was genuine. [Stockholm Center for Freedom](https://stockholmcf.org/erdogan-blocked-prosecution-of-ministers-implicated-in-2013-graft-probe-ex-akp-lawmaker/)

### 4.3 The 2016 Coup Attempt (July 15)

**Events**: On the night of July 15, 2016, a military faction attempted to overthrow the government. Tanks took to the streets, soldiers seized parliament's headquarters, and jets bombed the parliament building in Ankara. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Hulusi Akar was taken captive. [2016 Turkish Coup Attempt - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Turkish_coup_attempt)

**Defeat**: Erdogan used FaceTime to call citizens onto the streets. Thousands responded despite gunfire. Loyalist police and military forces resisted. The coup was defeated within hours.

**Casualties:**
- 251 civilians killed
- 2,734 injured

**Attribution**: Turkey blamed Fethullah Gulen's network (designated FETO - Fethullah Terrorist Organisation). Gulen, living in Pennsylvania, denied involvement. Western intelligence agencies found some Gulenist involvement but no hard evidence Gulen personally orchestrated it. The U.S. has denied extradition requests. [Al Jazeera - Turkey's Failed Coup Explainer](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/15/turkeys-failed-coup-attempt-explainer)

**State of Emergency**: Declared on July 22, 2016, and lasted two years. July 15 is now "Democracy and National Unity Day," and the Bosphorus Bridge was renamed "15 July Martyrs Bridge."

- Passports cancelled
- Social security database flagged, deterring private employers

### 5.2 Journalist Imprisonments

Turkey became the world's worst jailer of journalists:

**Peak (2016)**: 84 journalists imprisoned - "the most ever imprisoned by a nation in a year" according to CPJ. [CPJ - Turkey's Press Freedom Crisis](https://cpj.org/reports/2012/10/turkeys-press-freedom-crisis-summary/)

**RSF Assessment (2014-2024):**
- 5 journalists killed
- 131 imprisoned over the decade
- 77 convicted of "insulting the president"
- Hundreds more prosecuted

[RSF - Ten Years of State Hostility Under Erdogan](https://rsf.org/en/t%C3%BCrkiye-ten-years-state-hostility-towards-press-under-president-erdogan)

**Sentences:**
- Longest conviction: 166 years
- Longest sentence sought: 3,000 years
- Many face double life sentences without parole

Turkey ranked among top 10 worst jailers of journalists from 2012-2023. [CPJ - Drop in Jailed Turkish Journalists](https://cpj.org/2024/02/drop-in-jailed-turkish-journalists-belies-a-long-simmering-press-freedom-crisis/)

### 5.3 Kurdish Conflict Escalation

**The 2013-2015 Peace Process:**

In December 2012, Erdogan publicly announced negotiations with jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. The Dolmabahce Agreement (February 2015) elevated negotiations, with Kurdish representatives publicly stating demands for the first time. [2013-2015 PKK-Turkey Peace Process - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013–2015_PKK–Turkey_peace_process)

**June 2015 Election**: The pro-Kurdish HDP crossed the 10% threshold for the first time, winning 80 seats and denying the AKP its majority.

**Collapse (July 2015):**
- July 20: ISIS's Suruc bombing killed 32 Kurds; PKK accused Turkey of complicity
- July 22: Two police officers assassinated in Ceylanpinar (disputed attribution)
- July 24: Turkey launched large-scale operations against PKK and ISIS simultaneously

[MERIP - Kurdish Movement's Disparate Goals](https://www.merip.org/2020/08/the-kurdish-movements-disparate-goals-and-the-collapse-of-the-peace-process-with-turkey/)

**Aftermath:**
- 5,000+ deaths since 2015 (soldiers, militants, civilians) per International Crisis Group
- HDP leaders imprisoned on terrorism charges
- Elected Kurdish mayors replaced with government trustees
- Multiple closure cases against the HDP

## 6. Economic Policy

### 6.1 Initial Growth (2002-2013)

The AKP's first decade saw remarkable economic performance:

**GDP Growth:**
- 2002-2007: 7.2% annual average
- 2010: 8.8% growth
- 2011: 9.2% growth

[Economy of Turkey - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Turkey); [World Bank - Turkey Overview](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/turkey/overview)

**Per Capita Income:**
- 2002: $3,500
- 2008: $10,400
- 2012: $10,504

**Poverty and Inequality:**
- Poverty rate fell from 20%+ (2007) to 7.6% (2021)
- Gini coefficient declined from 0.49 (mid-1990s) to 0.38 (2005)
- Middle class expanded significantly

[MIT - Ups and Downs of Turkish Growth](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/The%20Ups%20and%20Downs%20of%20Turkish%20Growth%2C%202002-2015%20-%20P.pdf)

**Fiscal Improvements:**
- Public debt fell from 74% of GDP (2001) to under 40% (2008)
- Inflation dropped from 80% average (1990s) to single digits (2004)

**Anatolian Tigers**: A new entrepreneurial class emerged in central Anatolian cities (Kayseri, Gaziantep), becoming major exporters to the Middle East and North Africa.

### 6.2 Currency Crises (2018-Present)

The Turkish lira crisis began in 2018 and has persisted:

**2018 Crisis:**
- Lira fell from 4.0 to 7.0 per USD by August
- Companies struggled with dollar-denominated debt

[Turkish Economic Crisis (2018-current) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_economic_crisis_(2018–current))

**2021 Collapse:**
- Central Bank chief Naci Agbal (who raised rates) was replaced with Sahap Kavcioglu (who cut rates)
- Lira lost 44% of its value in 2021
- Lira plunged from 10 to 17 per dollar in December alone

[Al Jazeera - Turkey Economy New Policies](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/6/23/turkey-economy-new-policies-erdogan)

**Peak Inflation (2022):**
- October 2022: 85.5% annual inflation (24-year high)
- Food prices doubled
- Transport costs increased 123%

### 6.3 "Erdoganomics" - Unorthodox Monetary Policy

Erdogan's heterodox economic theory:

**Core belief**: Erdogan has called interest rates "a tool of exploitation" analogous to "the heroin trade" and "the mother and father of all evil." He argues cutting rates fights inflation, contrary to mainstream economics. [Washington Post - Erdogan's Unorthodox Views](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/how-erdogans-unorthodox-views-rattle-turkish-markets/2021/03/22/cbd4837c-8b37-11eb-a33e-da28941cb9ac_story.html)

**Religious dimension**: Reflects belief that interest (riba) is forbidden in Islam.

**Policy reversal (2023)**: After winning re-election, Erdogan appointed:
- Mehmet Simsek (former Merrill Lynch banker) as finance minister
- Hafize Gaye Erkan as central bank governor

Rates were raised from 8.5% to 50% by March 2024. Inflation dropped to 47% by November 2024. [Michigan Journal of Economics - Breakdown of Erdoganomics](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mje/2022/05/17/the-breakdown-of-erdoganomics/)

**2024 return to rhetoric**: Erdogan again called for rate cuts in late 2024, identifying 2025 as the year for "non-negotiable" rate reductions.

## 7. Foreign Policy

### 7.1 Syria Intervention

Turkey has conducted multiple military operations in Syria since 2016:

**Operation Euphrates Shield (August 2016 - March 2017):**
- Targeted ISIS and Kurdish YPG forces
- Captured Jarablus-al-Rai-al-Bab triangle
- First Turkish military occupation of Syrian territory

[Operation Euphrates Shield - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Euphrates_Shield)

**Operation Olive Branch (January-March 2018):**
- Targeted Kurdish Afrin region
- Captured entire Afrin District
- Better coordinated than Euphrates Shield

[CSIS - Understanding Turkey's Afrin Operation](https://www.csis.org/analysis/understanding-turkeys-afrin-operation)

**Political timing**: Operations coincided with key votes: April 2017 referendum, June 2018 elections, March 2019 municipal elections. Military nationalism boosted government support. [Carnegie Endowment - How Syria Changed Turkey's Foreign Policy](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/09/how-syria-changed-turkeys-foreign-policy?lang=en)

### 7.2 Russia Relations and the S-400 Crisis

**The S-400 Deal:**
- 2017: Erdogan agreed to purchase Russian S-400 missile system for $2.5 billion
- July 2019: First batteries delivered despite U.S./NATO warnings

[CNBC - US Sanctions Turkey over S-400](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/14/us-sanctions-turkey-over-russian-s400.html)

**Consequences:**
- Turkey removed from F-35 fighter program (had paid $1.4 billion)
- December 2020: CAATSA sanctions imposed, cutting Turkish defense procurement from U.S. financial institutions, military hardware, and technology
- S-400s have sat largely idle, tested once in 2020 near Sinop

[Brookings - Turkey's S-400 Purchase Paradigm Shifting](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/turkeys-purchase-of-russian-missile-defense-system-will-be-paradigm-shifting-for-its-relations-with-the-us/)

**2024 Development**: Reports that Erdogan discussed returning S-400s to Russia amid Moscow's equipment shortages in Ukraine. [Bloomberg - Turkey Russia S-400](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/turkey-russia-what-erdogan-returning-s-400-system-would-mean-for-us-ties)

### 7.3 NATO Tensions

**Sweden and Finland Membership (2022-2024):**

After Russia invaded Ukraine, Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership. Erdogan objected, demanding:
- End to support for PKK activities in Sweden
- Lifting of arms embargoes imposed after 2019 Turkish operations
- Extradition of Kurdish and Gulenist "terrorists"

[FPRI - The Turkish Veto](https://www.fpri.org/article/2023/03/the-turkish-veto-why-erdogan-is-blocking-finland-and-swedens-path-to-nato/)

**Resolution:**
- March 2023: Turkey approved Finland's membership
- July 2023: Turkey approved Sweden after concessions including extraditions, NATO counterterrorism coordinator, and (unofficially) U.S. agreement to support F-16 sales

[Georgetown - Turkey's Reversal on Sweden's NATO Bid](https://www.georgetown.edu/news/whats-behind-turkeys-reversal-on-swedens-nato-bid-a-foreign-policy-professor-answers/)

### 7.4 EU Refugee Deal (2016)

**March 2016 Agreement:**

Terms:
- Turkey accepts return of irregular migrants from Greek islands
- For every Syrian returned, EU resettles one Syrian from Turkey ("one-for-one")
- EU provides EUR 6 billion in grants
- Accelerated visa liberalization for Turkish citizens
- Re-energized EU accession process

[EU Council - EU-Turkey Statement](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/03/18/eu-turkey-statement/)

**Implementation:**
- EUR 5.7 billion disbursed (of EUR 6 billion committed)

## 9. Scholarly Debates: Competitive Authoritarianism in Turkey

### 9.1 Levitsky and Way Framework

Political scientists Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way developed the concept of "competitive authoritarianism" to describe regimes with more democratic features than full authoritarianism, but that should not be understood as democracies. [Democratic Erosion - Competitive Authoritarianism in Turkey](https://democratic-erosion.org/2022/12/31/competitive-authoritarianism-in-turkey/)

**Levitsky's own assessment (2023)**: "Turkey is a competitive authoritarian regime... I don't think the question is well framed in saying there's a danger to Turkish democracy. The danger's been there a long time and Turkey is not a democracy." [ECPS - Prof. Levitsky Interview](https://www.populismstudies.org/prof-levitsky-the-us-and-europe-accelerate-the-decline-of-western-liberalism-through-their-own-errors/)

### 9.2 Turkey's Double Transition

Scholars argue Turkey underwent two regime transitions under the AKP:
1. **Tutelary democracy ended** (military guardianship removed)
2. **Competitive authoritarianism rose** in its place

Turkey achieved full democracy briefly in the early 2000s during AKP's early years. Democratic backsliding began in the first decade and escalated after 2016. [Political Quarterly - Elections and Democracy in Turkey](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-923X.13309)

### 9.3 Key Debates

**Is Turkey still competitive authoritarian or fully authoritarian?**

Scholars note the difficulty in classification until elections demonstrate whether opposition can actually win. As Levitsky and Way argue, "if competitive authoritarian regimes do not become fully authoritarian, it is not because their leaders do not want to. Rather, it is because they cannot shake off the competitiveness of their political system." [Freedom House - End of Competitive Authoritarianism in Turkey](https://freedomhouse.org/article/end-competitive-authoritarianism-turkey)

**International linkage and leverage:**

EU proximity was initially viewed as a positive democratic influence. The AKP's first-term pro-EU attitude declined significantly by the second term. The rise of European far-right parties convinced many Turks the EU would never accept Turkey, reducing democratic pressure.

### 9.4 Democracy Index Classifications (2024)

| Organization | Classification | Ranking |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Economist Intelligence Unit | Hybrid regime | 103rd of 167 |
| Freedom House | Not Free | - |
| V-Dem | Electoral autocracy | - |

Turkey ranks lowest in Western Europe. Civil liberties scores are among the worst globally.

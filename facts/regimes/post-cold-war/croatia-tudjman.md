# Franjo Tuđman's Croatia (1990-1999)

## Overview

Franjo Tuđman (1922-1999) was the first president of independent Croatia, serving from 1990 until his death in December 1999. A former Yugoslav Partisan, communist general, and dissident historian, Tuđman led Croatia to independence through the violent dissolution of Yugoslavia. His regime combined nationalist mobilization with authoritarian governance, media control, and crony capitalism, while presiding over significant war crimes and ethnic cleansing during the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995) and Croatia's involvement in the Bosnian War (1992-1995).

---

## 1. Pre-Conditions

### Yugoslav Dissolution Context

The collapse of Yugoslavia in the late 1980s created the conditions for Tuđman's rise. Following Tito's death in 1980, Yugoslavia experienced escalating political and economic crises as central government authority weakened and nationalist movements grew.[^1] The 1986 Serbian SANU Memorandum and Slobodan Milošević's rise to power through nationalist mobilization threatened Croatian and Slovenian autonomy within the federation.[^2]

Key factors:
- **Economic disparities**: Croatia and Slovenia, the most developed republics, resisted attempts to limit their autonomy under the 1974 Constitution[^3]
- **Communist Party fragmentation**: In January 1990, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia split along national lines when Croatian and Slovenian delegates walked out of the 14th Congress[^4]
- **Serbian nationalist threat**: Milošević's consolidation of power through the "anti-bureaucratic revolution" (1988-1989) alarmed other republics[^5]

### Croatian Nationalism Revival

Croatian nationalism, suppressed after the "Croatian Spring" of 1971, revived in the late 1980s as a response to perceived Serbian hegemony under Milošević.[^6] The movement drew on:
- Historical grievances within the Yugoslav federation
- The legacy of the suppressed Croatian Spring reformers (MASPOK)
- Diaspora support, particularly from emigrant communities in Western Europe, North America, and Australia[^7]

### Tuđman's Personal Background

**Partisan Past (1941-1945)**

Born May 14, 1922, in Veliko Trgovišće, in the Hrvatsko Zagorje region north of Zagreb, Tuđman came from a politically active family. His father Stjepan was a Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) official and mayor.[^8]

After the Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Tuđman joined the Communist Partisans in early 1942. He advanced rapidly as a political commissar, ending the war as a 23-year-old major commanding the 32nd Partisan Division.[^9]

**Military Career (1945-1961)**

After the war, Tuđman served in the Ministry of Defence, becoming Yugoslavia's youngest general (major general) in 1960 at age 38.[^10]

**Historian and Dissident (1961-1989)**

In 1961, Tuđman left military service to become director of the Institute for the History of the Workers' Movement in Zagreb. He received his doctorate in history from the University of Zagreb in 1965.[^11]

His turn to nationalism came during the Croatian Spring:
- **1967**: Expelled from the Communist Party after signing the Declaration on the Croatian Language[^12]
- **1972**: Sentenced to two years in prison for nationalist activities (served 10 months)[^13]
- **1981**: Three-year prison sentence and five-year ban on public activity[^14]
- **1989**: Published *Horrors of War: Historical Reality and Philosophy*, questioning official victim counts from World War II[^15]

## 2. Rise to Power

### HDZ Founding (1989)

The Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska demokratska zajednica, HDZ) was founded on June 17, 1989, by Croatian dissidents led by Tuđman.[^16] The party was:
- Nationalist and anti-communist
- Rooted in Catholic and Croatian cultural traditions
- Supported financially by the Croatian diaspora, which provided millions of dollars[^17]

In November 1989, the HDZ became the first Croatian party to call for self-determination and secession from Yugoslavia.[^18]

### 1990 Election Victory

The first free multi-party elections in Croatia since 1913 were held in April-May 1990. The HDZ held its first convention on February 24-25, 1990, electing Tuđman as party president.[^19]

**Election Results:**
- HDZ won 46% of the popular vote
- Due to the majoritarian electoral system, this translated to 67% of parliamentary seats (205 of 356)[^20]
- The reformed communists under Ivica Račan came second

On May 30, 1990, the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) elected Tuđman as President of Croatia. This date was subsequently celebrated as Statehood Day.[^21]

### Independence Declaration (1991)

Following a referendum on May 19, 1991, in which 93% voted for independence (Serbs largely boycotted), the Croatian Parliament declared independence on June 25, 1991.[^22]

Key dates:
- **June 25, 1991**: Declaration of independence (simultaneously with Slovenia)
- **July-October 1991**: Three-month moratorium under EC/CSCE pressure
- **October 8, 1991**: Final severing of ties with Yugoslavia
- **December 19, 1991**: First recognition by an internationally recognized state (Iceland)[^23]
- **January 15, 1992**: Recognition by EC member states
- **May 22, 1992**: UN admission[^24]

---

## 3. The Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995)

### Serb Rebellion and SAO Krajina

The Croatian Serb rebellion began in August 1990 with the "Log Revolution" - road blockades in Serb-majority areas led by Milan Babić and Milan Martić.[^25]

Timeline of escalation:
- **August 17, 1990**: Log Revolution begins in Knin area
- **December 21, 1990**: SAO Krajina (Serbian Autonomous Oblast) proclaimed[^26]
- **March 31, 1991**: Plitvice Lakes incident - first fatalities of the conflict[^27]
- **May 2, 1991**: Battle of Borovo Selo - armed clashes escalate
- **December 19, 1991**: SAO Krajina proclaims itself the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK)[^28]

The JNA (Yugoslav People's Army), whose officer corps was 70% Serb or Montenegrin, increasingly sided with the rebels.[^29] The RSK, at its height, controlled approximately 30% of Croatian territory.

### The Siege of Vukovar (August-November 1991)

The Battle of Vukovar was an 87-day siege that became a defining moment of the war. The Baroque city in eastern Slavonia was defended by approximately 1,800 lightly armed Croatian National Guard soldiers and volunteers against up to 36,000 JNA troops and Serb paramilitaries.[^30]

Key facts:
- Shelling reached 12,000 rounds per day
- First major European city entirely destroyed since World War II
- City fell on November 18, 1991
- Approximately 3,000 people died during the battle[^31]

**Vukovar Hospital Massacre (Ovčara)**

On November 20, 1991, 261 prisoners taken from Vukovar hospital were transported to the Ovčara farm, beaten, and executed in groups of 10-12.[^32] This was the largest massacre of the Croatian War.

ICTY convictions:
- Mile Mrkšić: 20 years (murder, cruel treatment, torture)
- Veselin Šljivančanin: Initially 5 years (torture), increased to 17 on appeal, reduced to 10 on second appeal[^33]

### Military Operations and Victory

Croatia rebuilt its military with covert Western assistance and launched successful operations in 1995:

- **Operation Flash (May 1995)**: Recaptured Western Slavonia
- **Operation Storm (August 4-7, 1995)**: Recaptured Krajina (see Section 5)

The war ended with the Erdut Agreement (November 1995), providing for peaceful reintegration of Eastern Slavonia by 1998.[^34]

---

## 4. Methods of Control

### HDZ Party Dominance

The HDZ maintained single-party dominance throughout Tuđman's rule:
- Won every election from 1990 to 2000
- Controlled the presidency, parliament, and most local governments
- Extensive powers concentrated in Tuđman personally under the semi-presidential constitution[^35]

The system has been characterized as "authoritarian" and "nominally democratic" by Human Rights Watch and the US State Department.[^36]

### Media Control

**Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT)**

Within a month of taking power in 1990, the HDZ began transforming HRT into a party-controlled propaganda outlet:[^37]

- Mass purges of Serbs, leftists, and non-compliant journalists
- Staff sometimes removed by armed guards or police after war began
- HRT was the only national television network, reaching 90% of the population[^38]

**Treatment of Independent Media**

- Critical journalists drafted into military service (e.g., *Feral Tribune* editors)
- Print media under heavy HDZ influence
- Journalists of mixed Serb-Croat parentage dismissed as "enemies of Croatia"[^39]

### Nationalism as Legitimacy

The regime derived legitimacy primarily from:
1. **Independence achievement**: Presented as fulfillment of centuries-old Croatian aspirations
2. **War leadership**: Tuđman portrayed as "father of the nation" defending Croatia from Serbian aggression
3. **Ethnic identity politics**: Emphasis on Croatian Catholic identity vs. Serbian Orthodox "other"
4. **Historical rehabilitation**: Reframing of Croatian history to emphasize continuous statehood[^40]

The war itself served to unify Croatians across former ideological divides - Partisans and Ustasha descendants now on the same side against "Serbian aggression."[^41]

---

## 5. Operation Storm (August 4-7, 1995)

### Military Operation

Operation Storm was the largest European land battle between World War II and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine:[^42]

- **Objective**: Recapture RSK-held territory (10,400 km², 18.4% of Croatia)
- **Front**: 630 kilometers
- **Duration**: August 4-7, 1995
- **Result**: Complete Croatian military victory, collapse of RSK

### Mass Displacement

Estimates of displaced Serbs range from 150,000 to 250,000:[^43]

| Source | Displaced | Killed | Missing |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Most academic estimates | 150,000-200,000 | - | - |
| Serbian Commissariat for Refugees | 200,000 | ~1,700 | 700 |
| Serbian Commissariat (alternate) | 250,000 | 1,856 | 836 |

On August 4, RSK authorities ordered civilian evacuation, though scholarly debate continues over whether this was voluntary flight, organized evacuation, or forced expulsion.[^44]

### War Crimes

After the military operation, Croatian forces committed documented crimes against remaining Serb civilians:

- 677 mainly elderly Serbs killed (Croatian Helsinki Committee figure)[^45]
- Systematic destruction and plunder of Serb property
- Prevention of Serb return through discriminatory measures

### ICTY Proceedings

Three Croatian generals were indicted: Ante Gotovina, Mladen Markač, and Ivan Čermak.

**Trial Chamber Verdict (April 2011):**
- Gotovina: 24 years (persecution, deportation, plunder, murder, etc.)
- Markač: 18 years
- Čermak: Acquitted

The chamber found a "joint criminal enterprise whose objective was permanent removal of the Serb population from the Krajina region by force."[^46]

**Appeals Chamber Verdict (November 2012):**
- Both Gotovina and Markač acquitted and released
- Court found trial chamber erred in its "200 metre standard" for assessing artillery targeting
- 3-2 majority decision[^47]

The acquittal was celebrated in Croatia with over 100,000 gathering in Zagreb. Serbia's President Nikolić called it "scandalous, political and illegal."[^48]

### Contested Legacy

**Croatian View**: Operation Storm is celebrated annually on August 5 as "Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day." Official position: legitimate military operation that restored Croatian sovereignty and ended Serb ethnic cleansing of Croats.[^49]

**Serbian View**: Commemorated on August 4 as "Day of Remembrance for Killed and Displaced Serbs." Characterized as "pogrom," "genocide," and ethnic cleansing.[^50]

---

## 6. Bosnia Involvement

### The Karađorđevo Meeting (March 1991)

On March 25, 1991, Tuđman and Milošević met at the Karađorđevo hunting ground in Serbia. While officially discussing the Yugoslav crisis, numerous witnesses and subsequent evidence suggest they discussed partitioning Bosnia:[^51]

**Evidence for partition agreement:**
- US Ambassador Warren Zimmermann reported Tuđman claimed "the only solution is to divide up Bosnia between Serbia and Croatia"[^52]
- Paddy Ashdown testified at ICTY that Tuđman drew a partition map at a May 1995 London meeting[^53]
- ICTY findings in multiple cases reference partition plans

**Denials:**
- Both Tuđman and Milošević denied any agreement
- Some scholars argue no documentary evidence proves explicit agreement at Karađorđevo[^54]

### Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia

The Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia was proclaimed on November 18, 1991, in Bosnian territory with significant Croat populations.[^55]

**ICTY Findings:**
The Hague Tribunal ruled that Herzeg-Bosnia served as "a means for pursuing a joint criminal enterprise whose aim was to create a Croatian entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina, one with an overwhelming Croat majority, and to ultimately annex that entity to the Republic of Croatia."[^56]

The ICTY found Tuđman pursued a "dual policy":
- Publicly supporting Bosnian unity
- Privately seeking partition based on the Croatian Banovina borders[^57]

### Croat-Bosniak War (1992-1994)

Initially allies against Serb/JNA forces, Croats and Bosniaks turned against each other as refugees from Serbian ethnic cleansing created tensions in central Bosnia.[^58]

**The Ahmići Massacre (April 16, 1993)**

HVO forces killed 116 Bosniak civilians in the village of Ahmići, Lašva Valley:
- 32 women and 11 children among victims
- Youngest victim: 3-month-old infant
- Homes set on fire, mosque destroyed
- ICTY called it "one of the worst acts of ethnic cleansing in the area"[^59]

**Washington Agreement (March 1994)**

US-brokered agreement ended Croat-Bosniak conflict and created the Muslim-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.[^60]

### ICTY Convictions (Prlić et al.)

Six senior Herzeg-Bosnia officials were convicted in 2013 for crimes against Bosniaks (1992-1994):[^61]

| Defendant | Position | Sentence |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Jadranko Prlić | Prime Minister | 25 years |
| Bruno Stojić | Defence Minister | 20 years |
| Slobodan Praljak | HVO Commander | 20 years |
| Milivoj Petković | HVO Chief of Staff | 20 years |
| Valentin Ćorić | Military Police | 16 years |
| Berislav Pušić | Exchange Commission | 10 years |

The court found they participated in "a joint criminal enterprise...with the objective of removing the Muslim population from territories on which the Bosnian Croat leadership, acting in concert with the leadership of Croatia, wanted to establish Croat domination."[^62]

**Praljak's Suicide (November 2017)**

Upon confirmation of his sentence, Slobodan Praljak drank poison in the courtroom, dying shortly after. He declared: "Slobodan Praljak is not a war criminal. I reject the verdict."[^63]

---

## 7. ICTY Issues

### Tuđman's Avoided Indictment

Tuđman was never formally indicted by the ICTY, dying before charges could be filed. However:

**Evidence of potential indictment:**
- OTP (Office of the Prosecutor) reportedly prepared indictment materials
- Louise Arbour, then Chief Prosecutor, rejected a proposed indictment for Medak Pocket crimes for insufficient evidence linking Tuđman personally[^64]
- Stronger case reportedly existed for Bosnia-related crimes

**Posthumous findings:**
Through the Joint Criminal Enterprise (JCE) doctrine, Tuđman was found culpable in the Prlić et al. case - the court determined he headed the criminal enterprise even though he was never personally tried.[^65] German politician Klaus-Peter Willsch compared this to the 897 Cadaver Synod trial of Pope Formosus.[^66]

### Croatian Generals' Cases

**Operation Storm (Gotovina et al.):**
- Initial convictions overturned on appeal (2012)
- Generals received heroes' welcome in Zagreb

**Bosnia Cases:**
- Six Herzeg-Bosnia officials' convictions upheld (2017)
- Croatian government expressed "deep regret" at verdicts
- Praljak's suicide televised live[^67]

---

## 8. Corruption and Crony Capitalism

### Privatization Scandals

Croatia's privatization under Tuđman created a new class of HDZ-connected "tycoons":[^68]

**Patterns of corruption:**
- State enterprises transferred to HDZ members or loyalists
- Below-market prices for politically connected buyers
- New managers appointed based on party loyalty, not competence
- Foreign investment discouraged by lack of transparency[^69]

The alleged "200 families" statement - that 200 wealthy families would manage Croatian economy - is frequently attributed to Tuđman, though some scholars note no evidence he actually said this.[^70]

### HDZ Financing

The party relied heavily on:
- Diaspora contributions gathered during Tuđman's foreign trips
- Connections to privatization beneficiaries
- Control over state resources through government positions[^71]

**Key scandals:**
- Dubrovačka banka crisis (senior HDZ figures implicated)
- Tuđman family finances allegations
- Defence ministry as conduit for non-transparent funding to Bosnian Croats[^72]

### Post-Tuđman Prosecutions

After HDZ's 2000 electoral defeat, several 1990s-era tycoons were prosecuted:
- Multiple convictions for privatization abuses (2000-2003)
- General privatization structure remained largely unchanged
- Later major scandal: Fimi Media case involving PM Ivo Sanader[^73]

---

## 9. Ustasha Rehabilitation and Historical Revisionism

### "National Reconciliation" Policy

Tuđman promoted *pomirba* (reconciliation) between Partisan and Ustasha descendants:[^74]

**1990 HDZ Congress Statement:**
Tuđman declared the NDH (Independent State of Croatia, 1941-1945) was "not simply a quisling entity but an expression of the political desires of the Croat nation for its own independent state."[^75]

**Practical implications:**
- Moral equivalence between antifascist and fascist traditions
- Both sides portrayed as motivated by Croatian independence
- Wartime crimes relativized as "excesses" on both sides[^76]

### NDH Symbols Revival

Under Tuđman's government:[^77]

- Streets named after Ustasha leaders (Mile Budak, Jure Francetić)
- *Kuna* restored as currency (name used by NDH)
- Former NDH officials appointed to government positions
- HOS (Croatian Defence Forces) paramilitaries used NDH symbols
- "Za dom spremni" salute (Ustasha equivalent of "Sieg Heil") tolerated at public events[^78]

### Jasenovac Minimization

Tuđman's 1989 book *Horrors of War* claimed only 30,000-40,000 died at Jasenovac concentration camp.[^79]

**Current scholarly consensus:**
- 77,000-99,000 victims (US Holocaust Memorial Museum)
- 83,145 documented victims (Jasenovac Memorial Site)
- 90,000-130,000 (2019 Uppsala University academic conference)[^80]

**Jasenovac Memorial controversy (1996):**
Tuđman proposed reburying Ustasha perpetrators alongside victims at the Jasenovac site. The plan was abandoned after protests from:
- Croatian Jewish community
- Partisan veterans' organizations
- US Holocaust Memorial Museum
- International Jewish organizations[^81]

### Continuing Legacy

Issues persisting after Tuđman's death:
- Half of ~20 streets named after Mile Budak in the 1990s still existed in 2019
- Annual Bleiburg commemoration (honoring NDH forces) draws controversy
- Minority community boycott of official Jasenovac commemoration since 2016
- "Za dom spremni" salute remains widespread at public gatherings[^82]

---

## 10. Death and Legacy

### Death (December 1999)

Tuđman was diagnosed with cancer in 1993, reportedly stomach or abdominal cancer, possibly with metastasis to the brain by 1999.[^83]

- **November 1, 1999**: Last public appearance
- **December 10, 1999**: Died at 11:40 PM in Zagreb clinic, age 77
- **December 13, 1999**: State funeral at Zagreb Cathedral; buried at Mirogoj Cemetery[^84]

Opposition parties accused HDZ of concealing his condition or death before January 2000 elections.[^85]

### 2000 Democratic Transition

The January 3, 2000, parliamentary elections marked Croatia's first democratic transition of power:[^86]

**Results:**
- SDP-HSLS coalition: 71 seats (38.7%)
- HSS-led coalition: 24 seats (16.4%)
- HDZ: 46 seats (31.5%)

**New government priorities:**
- Pro-Western orientation
- EU and NATO integration
- ICTY cooperation
- Economic reform and anti-corruption measures[^87]

Stipe Mesić won the presidential election on February 7, 2000, completing the transition.

### Contested Memory

Tuđman remains a deeply polarizing figure:

**Positive assessments:**
- "Father of the nation" who achieved Croatian independence
- Led successful defense against Serbian aggression
- Founder of Croatian statehood celebrated on official holidays

**Critical assessments:**
- Authoritarian ruler who undermined democracy
- Presided over war crimes and ethnic cleansing
- Historical revisionist who rehabilitated fascism
- Created corrupt crony capitalist system
- International pariah who damaged Croatia's reputation[^88]

---

## Scholarly Debates

### On Nationalism

**Key question**: Was Tuđman's nationalism primarily reactive (response to Serbian threat) or ideologically driven?

**Arguments for reactive nationalism:**
- Croatian nationalism escalated in response to Milošević's actions
- HDZ explicitly campaigned on "protecting Croatia from Milošević"
- War circumstances required national mobilization[^89]

**Arguments for ideological nationalism:**
- Tuđman's nationalist writings predate Milošević's rise
- NDH rehabilitation unnecessary for defensive purposes
- Ethnic exclusivism exceeded military necessity[^90]

**Scholarly works:**
- Ivo Banac argues Tuđmanism united "both dominant strands of Croatian anti-liberalism": fascist sympathizers and former communists[^91]
- Vjeran Pavlaković examines the "Ustaša-nostalgia" phenomenon in Croatian nation-building[^92]
- Bette Denich compares Tuđman's revisionism to Ernst Nolte's during the German Historikerstreit[^93]

### On "Ethnic Cleansing" Definition

**The core debate**: Does Operation Storm constitute ethnic cleansing?

**Definitional framework:**
Ethnic cleansing is "a purposeful policy of rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove from a given area persons from another ethnic group."[^94]

**Legal rulings:**
- ICTY Appeals Chamber (2012): Acquitted generals; found no joint criminal enterprise to forcibly expel Serbs
- Dissenting judges cited Tuđman transcripts as evidence of intent
- February 2015 ICJ ruling: Siege of Vukovar and related atrocities did not constitute genocide[^95]

**Statistical evidence:**
- Croatian Serb population: 12.2% (1991) → 4.5% (2001)
- Question: Was this population change result of war, voluntary emigration, or deliberate policy?[^96]

**Key distinction:**
Even ICTY majority ruling acknowledged that:
1. Croatian forces committed "a high number of crimes" against Serbs
2. Croatia "adopted discriminatory measures to make it increasingly difficult for Serbs to return"
3. But this did not prove pre-meditated plan to expel the population[^97]

**Scholarly positions vary:**
- Some characterize Operation Storm as "the biggest single instance of ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav Wars"
- Others emphasize prior ethnic cleansing of Croats from Krajina (170,000-250,000 expelled 1991-1995)
- Debate continues over whether RSK evacuation order was autonomous decision or coordinated with Croatian advance[^98]

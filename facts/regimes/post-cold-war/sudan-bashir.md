## Overview

Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir (born 1944) ruled Sudan for 30 years (1989-2019) following a military coup backed by the National Islamic Front. His regime was characterized by Islamist ideology, systematic repression through a powerful security apparatus, and multiple devastating conflicts that killed over 2 million people. In 2009-2010, he became the first sitting head of state indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur. His regime hosted Osama bin Laden (1991-1996), implemented strict Sharia law, and pursued what the U.S. government designated as "genocide" in Darfur through the Janjaweed militias. He was overthrown in April 2019 following mass protests and remains wanted by the ICC.

## 1. Pre-Conditions for Rise

### Colonial Legacy and Independence (1956)

From 1899 until independence in 1956, Sudan was jointly governed by British and Egyptian authorities (the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium). The British colonial administration pursued "divide and rule" policies that created and deepened ethnic divisions between the predominantly Arab and Muslim north and the ethnically African, Christian, and animist south. These divisions would fuel decades of civil war.

### The First Civil War (1955-1972)

Civil war erupted even before independence, beginning in 1955. The First Sudanese Civil War resulted from deep-rooted ethnic, religious, and cultural divisions:

- **Death toll**: Estimated 500,000 to 1 million
- **Duration**: 1955-1972
- **Key dynamic**: Predominantly Muslim and Arabic-speaking north vs. diverse, multi-ethnic, largely Christian south
- **Government policies**: Under military rule, particularly Brigadier General Ibrahim Abboud, repressive policies were implemented against the south

The war ended with the **Addis Ababa Agreement** (1972), which granted religious and cultural autonomy to the south and was incorporated into Sudan's constitution.

### The Nimeiry Era (1969-1985)

**Colonel Gaafar Nimeiry** seized power in a military coup on May 25, 1969:

- **Initial period**: Outlawed political parties; survived an internal coup attempt by communist factions in July 1971
- **Peace period**: Ended the First Civil War with the Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)
- **Violations begin**: Attempted to take control of oil fields straddling the north-south border, violating the accords
- **September Laws (1983)**: Declared all of Sudan an Islamic state, implemented Sharia law including hudud punishments (public flogging for alcohol consumption, amputations for theft), terminated the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region
- **Fall**: A short-lived coup unseated Nimeiry on April 6, 1985

The September Laws and termination of southern autonomy directly triggered the Second Sudanese Civil War.

### The Second Sudanese Civil War Begins (1983)

The Second Sudanese Civil War erupted in 1983 after Nimeiry's declaration of Islamic law:

- **SPLA/M formation**: On May 16, 1983, an army battalion at Bor mutinied and formed the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM)
- **Leader**: Colonel John Garang de Mabior
- **Duration**: 1983-2005 (one of the longest civil wars on record)
- **Death toll**: Approximately 2 million people
- **Displacement**: 4 million people displaced, often multiple times
- **Character**: Marked by numerous human rights violations, including slavery and mass killings

### Economic and Political Crisis (1985-1989)

Following Nimeiry's fall:

- **Democratic transition**: General Abdel Rahman Swar al-Dahab led a transitional government; elections held in 1986 brought Sadiq al-Mahdi to power
- **September Laws**: Though the new government suspended the 1983 constitution and declaration of Islamic statehood, Sharia law provisions were not rescinded
- **War continues**: Fighting between government forces and the SPLA continued
- **1988 protests**: Economic strain from the war sparked protests across Sudan
- **Peace agreement**: By 1989, a peace agreement had been reached with the SPLM/A, with a vote scheduled to rescind the September Laws

## 2. Rise to Power: The 1989 Coup

### The Coup (June 30, 1989)

The military coup occurred just 24 hours before the government was scheduled to vote on rescinding the September Laws:

- **Date**: June 30, 1989
- **Leader**: Brigadier General Omar al-Bashir
- **Targets**: Democratically elected Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and President Ahmed al-Mirghani
- **Method**: Bloodless coup carried out by military officers with National Islamic Front (NIF) backing
- **Immediate actions**: Repudiated the peace agreement with the SPLM, severe repression including purges and executions in army upper ranks, banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers

### The NIF and Hassan al-Turabi

The coup's true architect was **Hassan al-Turabi**, leader of the National Islamic Front:

- **NIF origins**: Established in 1985 as the political party of Sudan's Islamist Movement, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood
- **Strategy**: The coup was "orchestrated under the guise of a military takeover because regional powers were hostile to the Muslim Brotherhood"
- **Turabi's role**: Served as the "intellectual architect" or "the power behind the throne" from 1989 until 2001
- **Alliance**: Bashir allied with Turabi to institutionalize Sharia law and begin systematic Islamization of the state

Sources: [Hassan al-Turabi - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turabi), [Britannica - Omar al-Bashir](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Omar-Hassan-Ahmad-al-Bashir), [Middle East Monitor - Remembering the 1989 Coup](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20230630-remembering-the-1989-coup-in-sudan/)

### Bashir-Turabi Split (1999-2000)

Tensions grew during the 1990s as Turabi attempted to constrain presidential power:

- **Power struggle**: Turabi used his position as speaker of the National Assembly to restrain Bashir, demanding he step down as military head
- **December 1999**: Bashir purged Turabi and his loyalists from the party and government
- **Imprisonment**: On Bashir's orders, Turabi was imprisoned in 2000 on conspiracy allegations, released in October 2003, imprisoned again in March 2004, released July 2005
- **Death**: Turabi died in 2016 without facing trial for his role in the 1989 coup

## 3. Methods of Control

### Islamist Ideology and Sharia Law

**The 1991 Criminal Code**: Two years after seizing power, Bashir implemented comprehensive Islamic criminal law:

- **Hudud offenses**: Full range including drinking alcohol, apostasy (ridda), adultery (zina), armed robbery (hiraba), and theft
- **Punishments**: Death by hanging, stoning, crucifixion, and flogging
- **Apostasy**: Renouncing Islam became punishable by death under Section 126
- **Alcohol**: 40 lashes for Muslims, 20 for Christians
- **Rape/adultery confusion**: Original law conflated rape and adultery, meaning rape victims who couldn't prove their case could be punished for adultery (100 lashes if unmarried, death by stoning if married)
- **Geographic scope**: Applied throughout the North, but not the South (January 1991)

### The Security Apparatus: NISS

The **National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS)** became the regime's most powerful instrument:

- **Legal powers**: Officers had powers of arrest, search, seizure; could detain individuals for prolonged periods in the name of "national security"
- **Codification**: Officially established by the National Security Forces Act of 1999
- **Functions**: Silenced opposition, censored press, engaged in arbitrary arrest and torture in "ghost houses"
- **Oversight function**: Tasked with spying on all government agencies, including other coercive bodies
- **Military capacity**: By 2008, regularized as a fighting force with formal oversight of multiple ethnic militias
- **Key figures**:
  - **Salah Gosh**: Head of NISS, orchestrated crackdowns on civil society, coordinated the 2019 coup against Bashir
  - **Nafie Ali Nafie**: Headed internal security in the 1990s, established notorious torture centers

### Fragmented Security Sector

Bashir deliberately fragmented the security apparatus to prevent coordinated threats:

- **Multiple forces**: Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), NISS, police, Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and various militias
- **Mutual surveillance**: Each force checked the others; NISS had operatives embedded throughout
- **Personal loyalty**: Ensured intelligence apparatus remained loyal to Bashir personally
- **Paramilitary counterweight**: Created the RSF from Janjaweed factions in 2013, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), whom Bashir dubbed "Himayti" (my protector)

### The Popular Defense Forces (PDF)

The **Popular Defense Forces** were created as a dedicated Islamist paramilitary:

- **Formation**: Established by decree in November 1989, consolidated in 1992
- **Model**: Based on Iran's Revolutionary Guards
- **Purpose**: Primary instrument of Islamist political and popular mobilization; waging jihad against southern rebels
- **Composition**: Conscripted government workers and university students
- **Role in Darfur**: Main instrument for mobilization, sending "tens of thousands of Darfurians to fight against southern rebels"
- **Ideological function**: Promoted Arab and Islamic identity across Sudan as part of the regime's "Civilization Project"

> According to critics, "This force is not a PDF as claimed by Umar al-Bashir, but rather an Islamic defence force created to wage a jihad, Islamic holy war, and nothing more."

### Single-Party Rule: The National Congress Party (NCP)

The **National Congress Party** dominated all political life:

- **Origins**: Established in 1998 by key NIF figures as the only legally recognized political party
- **Control**: Dominated all regional governorships; held two-thirds majority of National Assembly
- **Post-2011**: Controlled 316 of 354 seats in the National Assembly after South Sudan's secession
- **Elections**: In December 2000 elections, won 355 of 360 seats; Bashir "re-elected" with 86.5% of the vote
- **Opposition suppression**: Political Parties Advisory Council controlled registration of political parties and was not independent
- **Mechanisms**: Violent repression, buying loyalty of opposition parties, international support during the oil boom (1999-2011)

### Divide-and-Rule Ethnic Politics

The regime systematically exploited ethnic divisions:

- **1994 administrative reorganization**: Gave members of Arab ethnic groups new positions of power in Darfur, undermining traditional leadership of Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa communities
- **Militia strategy**: Armed Arab militias (Janjaweed) to attack African ethnic groups perceived as supporting rebels
- **Client militias**: Various ethnic militias placed under NISS oversight

## 4. The Islamist Period and Terrorism Ties (1991-1996)

### Hosting Osama bin Laden (1991-1996)

Sudan became a haven for international terrorists during the early 1990s:

- **Arrival**: Osama bin Laden relocated from Afghanistan to Sudan in early 1991
- **Activities**: Established business operations in Khartoum (Wadi al-Aqiq), invested in infrastructure, agriculture, and businesses
- **Training camps**: Set up training camps for mujahideen operations
- **Base**: Bought a house in the affluent Al-Riyadh quarter and a retreat at Soba on the Blue Nile
- **Relationship with Turabi**: Bin Laden "agreed to help Turabi in an ongoing war against African Christian separatists in southern Sudan and also to do some road building." In return, Turabi let bin Laden use Sudan as a base for worldwide operations

### The Popular Arab and Islamic Congress (PAIC)

Turabi created an international Islamist network:

- **First congress**: Held in Khartoum, April 25-28, 1991, with 200 delegates from various Islamic states and movements
- **Attendees**: Included Yasser Arafat and representatives of radical Islamic movements
- **Purpose**: Develop and coordinate Islamic revolution internationally
- **Turabi's role**: Secretary-General of the permanent secretariat

Sources: [Terrorism and Political Violence - Hassan al-Turabi](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546550600752022)

### Carlos the Jackal

- **Arrival**: Ilich Ramirez Sanchez ("Carlos the Jackal") arrived in Sudan in 1993 under a Jordanian passport
- **Participation**: Identified at the PAIC General Assembly in Khartoum, December 2-4, 1993
- **Capture**: In 1994, Turabi aided France in capturing Carlos, later seen by U.S. analysts as "a sop to Western concerns rather than a change in Sudan's terrorism policy"

Sources: [CNN - Sudanese Islamist Leader, Bin Laden Ally Hassan al-Turabi Dies](https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/05/africa/sudan-hassan-al-turabi-dies)

### State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation

- **Designation**: Sudan was added to the U.S. State Sponsors of Terrorism list on August 12, 1993
- **Allegations**: Harbored members of Abu Nidal Organization, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, Palestine Islamic Jihad, and Hamas
- **Context**: Carlos the Jackal, Osama bin Laden, Abu Nidal, and other terrorist leaders resided in Khartoum
- **Bin Laden's expulsion**: On May 18, 1996, under pressure from the U.S., Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, Sudan expelled bin Laden, pushing him to Afghanistan
- **Embassy bombings connection**: Sudan later paid $335 million in compensation to families of victims of the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
- **Removal from list**: December 14, 2020

## 5. The Darfur Genocide (2003-2010+)

### Background and Causes

Darfur, a region in western Sudan, had experienced tensions between sedentary African farmers (Fur, Masalit, Zaghawa) and pastoralist Arab tribes for decades. Contributing factors included:

- Extended periods of drought
- Competition for dwindling resources
- Lack of governance and democracy
- Easy availability of weapons
- 1994 administrative reorganization favoring Arab groups

In February 2003, two rebel groups emerged:
- **Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM)**
- **Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)**

Both demanded an end to chronic economic marginalization and sought power-sharing in the Arab-ruled Sudanese state.

Sources: [HRW - Darfur Destroyed](https://www.hrw.org/report/2004/05/06/darfur-destroyed/ethnic-cleansing-government-and-militia-forces-western-sudan), [USHMM - Darfur](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/darfur)

### The Janjaweed Militias

The government's response was to arm Arab militias known as the **Janjaweed** ("Devils on Horseback"):

- **Formation**: Government exploited ethnic differences by arming Arab militia groups
- **Tactics**: Combined operations with Sudanese military; government attacked from the air with helicopter gunships or Antonov bombers, then Janjaweed swept in on horseback
- **Scorched earth**: Burned villages, poisoned wells, destroyed crops, seized livestock
- **Atrocities**: Killing and mutilating men, raping women, killing or kidnapping children
- **Targets**: Civilian populations of the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa ethnic groups, perceived as supporting rebels

> "A typical Janjaweed raid would open with an attack by the Sudanese air force... Within hours, mounted Janjaweed would sweep into the area, killing and mutilating the men, raping the women, and killing or kidnapping the children."

### Death Toll and Displacement

Estimates vary significantly:

| Source | Death Toll Estimate | Displacement |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| UN (2013) | Up to 300,000 | 2.5 million |
| General estimates (2015) | 100,000-400,000 | 2.7 million |
| USHMM | 300,000+ | 2.5 million+ |

The genocide is ongoing, with the Rapid Support Forces (successor to Janjaweed factions) continuing to target the same communities in the current civil war. In 2025, the U.S. Secretary of State determined that RSF members are committing genocide in Darfur.

### International Response

- **September 9, 2004**: U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell declared genocide was occurring in Darfur and that the Sudanese government had supported the Janjaweed "directly and indirectly"
- **UN Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005)**: Referred Sudan to the International Criminal Court
- **African Union Mission**: Deployed peacekeepers (AMIS), later transitioned to joint UN-AU mission (UNAMID)

## 6. ICC Indictment: A Historic First

### First Arrest Warrant (March 4, 2009)

The International Criminal Court issued its first-ever arrest warrant for a sitting head of state:

- **Charges**: Five counts of crimes against humanity (murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture, rape) and two counts of war crimes (pillaging, intentionally directing attacks against civilians)
- **Judges**: Pre-Trial Chamber I composed of Akua Kuenyehia (Ghana), Anita Usacka (Latvia), and Sylvia Steiner (Brazil)
- **Historical significance**: First sitting head of state to be wanted by the ICC

### Second Arrest Warrant with Genocide Charges (July 12, 2010)

Following an appeals court reversal:

- **February 3, 2010**: Appeals Chamber unanimously reversed decision not to include genocide
- **July 12, 2010**: Pre-Trial Chamber I issued second arrest warrant
- **Charges**: Three counts of genocide against the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa:
  - Genocide by killing
  - Genocide by causing serious bodily or mental harm
  - Genocide by deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to bring about physical destruction
- **Historic firsts**: First genocide charges before the ICC; first sitting head of state charged with genocide

### Jurisdiction and Non-Cooperation

- **Sudan's status**: Not a state party to the Rome Statute
- **UN referral**: Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005) gave the ICC jurisdiction and obligated Sudan to cooperate
- **Enforcement failure**: Bashir visited numerous ICC member states without arrest despite the warrants
- **Notable incidents**:
  - **2015**: South Africa refused to arrest Bashir during the African Union summit; Constitutional Court later ruled this was unlawful
  - **Jordan**: Found to be uncooperative for refusing to arrest Bashir during a visit
- **African Union position**: Adopted resolutions calling for non-cooperation, arguing the indictment could undermine peace efforts

## 7. South Sudan: From Civil War to Independence

### The Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005)

The war, reignited by Nimeiry's September Laws, continued under Bashir:

- **Duration**: 22 years (one of the longest civil wars on record)
- **Death toll**: Approximately 2 million people
- **Displacement**: 4 million people (often repeatedly)
- **Character**: One of the deadliest conflicts since World War II
- **Human rights violations**: Slavery, mass killings, deliberate starvation

### John Garang and the SPLA/M

**John Garang de Mabior** (1945-2005) led the southern resistance:

- **Vision**: Advocated for a united secular Sudan with equal opportunities, rather than outright independence
- **Opposition**: This position conflicted with other SPLA leaders like Riek Machar who favored complete independence
- **Legacy**: Considered the father of South Sudanese independence despite his preference for unity

Sources: [John Garang - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Garang), [CFR - Instability in South Sudan](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/civil-war-south-sudan)

### Comprehensive Peace Agreement (January 2005)

The CPA ended the civil war:

- **Signatories**: President Omar al-Bashir and John Garang
- **Key provisions**:
  - New national constitution
  - Power-sharing arrangements
  - Wealth distribution (including oil revenue sharing)
  - Separate administration for southern Sudan
  - Referendum on independence after six years
- **Implementation**: Garang became First Vice President of Sudan
- **Tragedy**: Garang died in a helicopter crash on July 30, 2005, just three weeks after assuming office

### Independence (July 9, 2011)

- **Referendum**: January 2011, nearly 99% voted for independence
- **Independence**: July 9, 2011, South Sudan became the world's newest nation
- **Economic impact**: Sudan lost approximately 75% of its oil revenue

Sources: [CFR - Instability in South Sudan](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/civil-war-south-sudan)

### South Sudan's Post-Independence Civil War (2013-present)

Independence did not bring peace:

- **Eruption**: December 2013, political crisis became armed conflict
- **Ethnic dimension**: Dinka militias (supporting President Salva Kiir) vs. Nuer forces (loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar)
- **Spread**: Eventually involved several of Sudan's 64 ethnic groups
- **Atrocities**: All sides targeted civilians based on ethnic identity through murder, rape, assault, and torture

## 8. Other Conflicts

### Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile (2011-present)

The CPA left critical regions unresolved:

- **The Two Areas**: South Kordofan (containing the Nuba Mountains) and Blue Nile state
- **Problem**: Unlike South Sudan, these regions were not given options for autonomy, independence, or joining South Sudan
- **Conflict restart**: Fighting broke out in South Kordofan on June 5, 2011, spreading to Blue Nile in September
- **Combatants**: Sudanese Armed Forces vs. Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N)
- **Historical context**: War in Nuba Mountains began in 1985, intensified after NIF took power in 1989, peaked in 1992-93

**The Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF)** formed on November 12, 2011, uniting:
- SPLM-North (Blue Nile and South Kordofan)
- Justice and Equality Movement (Darfur)

### Eastern Front (1997-2006)

Conflict in eastern Sudan along the Eritrea border:

- **Region**: Red Sea, Kassala, and Gedarif states
- **Marginalization**: Among the most marginalized regions in Sudan despite strategic location and resources (oil pipeline, major gold mine)
- **Rebel groups**:
  - **Beja Congress**: Formed 1958, armed conflict began 1997
  - **Rashaida Free Lions**: Tribal-based group
  - **Eastern Front**: Coalition formed February 2004
- **Grievances**: Government inequity in distribution of oil profits
- **Resolution**: Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (ESPA), signed October 14, 2006, in Asmara, mediated by Eritrea
- **Implementation failures**: Integration of former fighters into civil and military services never implemented; Beja Congress withdrew from agreement in 2011

## 9. Fall from Power (2018-2019)

### The December Revolution (December 2018 - April 2019)

Economic crisis triggered mass protests:

**Immediate causes**:
- Bread prices tripled overnight (December 19, 2018)
- Government ended wheat and fuel subsidies at IMF recommendation
- ~70% inflation (second only to Venezuela)
- Currency devaluation (October 2018)
- Shortages of basic goods, fuel, and cash

**Chronology**:
- **December 18-19, 2018**: Protests begin in Damazine (Blue Nile state) and Atbara
- **January 1, 2019**: Formation of Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) coordinating civil resistance
- **February 22, 2019**: Bashir declares state of emergency, dissolves national and regional governments
- **April 6, 2019**: Largest demonstration since protests began; protesters march to military headquarters in Khartoum, begin sit-in
- **April 10, 2019**: Soldiers seen shielding protesters from security forces
- **April 11, 2019**: Military removes Bashir from power

> The protests' eloquent slogan: "Tasqot bas" ("Just Fall")

### The 2019 Coup

- **Date**: April 11, 2019
- **Announcement**: General Awad Ibn Auf (Bashir's vice president and defense minister) announced joint removal by SAF, NISS, RSF, and police
- **Immediate aftermath**: Constitution suspended, two-year military transitional government announced
- **Ibn Auf's fall**: Within 36 hours, protesters demanded his ouster; replaced by Lt. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan as head of Transitional Military Council (TMC), with Hemedti as deputy
- **Bashir's fate**: Moved to Kober prison; large sums of money discovered in his home led to corruption charges
- **June 3, 2019 massacre**: RSF and other security forces killed 128 people, raped 70, at the Khartoum sit-in
- **Power-sharing**: August 2019, agreement reached; August 21, transitional Sovereignty Council comprising military and civilian representatives took power

### The Role of NISS in Bashir's Fall

Ironically, the fragmented security apparatus Bashir created united to remove him:

- **Salah Gosh** (NISS head) coordinated the coup, using NISS operatives embedded in other security organs
- **Key coordination**: Gosh convinced Hemedti (RSF leader) to agree to the coup
- **Outcome**: The same security forces that had maintained Bashir's rule for 30 years ultimately removed him

## 10. Aftermath and Current Status

### Bashir's Imprisonment and Trials

- **Corruption trial**: Convicted on corruption charges; large sums of cash found in his home
- **1989 coup trial**: In July 2020, Bashir stood trial over the 1989 coup that brought him to power
- **ICC commitment (unfulfilled)**: On February 11, 2020, transitional government announced it would hand Bashir to the ICC; this never occurred
- **2021 coup**: Military coup led by Burhan ended the civilian transition

### Release and Current Whereabouts (2023-present)

- **April 2023**: Civil war erupts between SAF (Burhan) and RSF (Hemedti)
- **Release**: Bashir, along with other ICC indictees Ahmad Harun and Abdel Raheem Hussein, released from Kober prison during the fighting
- **Current status**: At large; whereabouts uncertain
- **ICC warrants**: Four arrest warrants remain outstanding (Bashir, Harun, Hussein, Abdallah Banda)

### The Sudan Civil War (2023-present)

The current conflict stems directly from Bashir-era structures:

- **Outbreak**: April 15, 2023
- **Combatants**: SAF (Burhan) vs. RSF (Hemedti)
- **Origins**: Rivalry between the two generals who overthrew Bashir; RSF traces directly to Janjaweed militias
- **Humanitarian impact**:
  - Nearly 12 million people forcibly displaced (one of largest displacement crises in history)
  - Death toll: 20,000+ (UN mid-2024 estimate); possibly 61,000+ (June 2024)
- **Key developments (2024-2025)**:
  - RSF controlled most of Darfur, advanced in Khartoum through late 2023
  - SAF launched major offensive September 2024
  - March 2025: SAF regained control of Khartoum
  - RSF atrocities continue in Darfur; Yale report assessed "widespread and systematic mass killings" in El Fasher
- **Current political situation**: Two rival governments - SAF's "Hope Government" in Port Sudan (east) and RSF's "Government of Peace and Unity" in Nyala, Darfur (west)
- **Foreign involvement**: Wagner Group and UAE support deepening the conflict

### NCP Resurgence

Despite being banned after Bashir's overthrow, the National Congress Party has resurged:

- Backing the military's campaign against RSF
- Loyalists landing cabinet posts under Prime Minister Kamil Idris
- Reasserted influence across military and bureaucracy

### Post-Bashir Reforms (Partially Reversed)

The transitional government made significant legal reforms in 2020:

- Abolished death penalty for apostasy
- Repealed Public Order Laws
- Removed some discriminatory provisions from the 1991 Criminal Code

These reforms are now in question given the 2021 coup and ongoing civil war.

## 11. Scholarly Debates

### The Genocide Question

**Central controversy**: Whether events in Darfur meet the legal definition of genocide under the UN Genocide Convention.

**The definition challenge**: The Convention requires both:
- **Actus reus** (physical acts): Killing, causing serious harm, imposing destructive conditions, preventing births, or forcibly transferring children
- **Mens rea** (mental element): "Intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, as such"

**Positions**:

| Entity | Position | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **U.S. Government** (2004) | Genocide | Violence was systematic, intentional, state-supported, targeted ethnic groups for destruction |
| **UN Commission of Inquiry** (2006) | Not genocide (but serious crimes) | Actus reus met, but mens rea (specific intent) not proven; crimes against humanity and war crimes may be "no less serious" |
| **ICC** (2010) | Genocide charges filed | Reasonable grounds to suspect Bashir acted with specific intent to destroy Fur, Masalit, Zaghawa |

**Key debates**:
- How to determine perpetrator intent during an ongoing crisis?
- What threshold of "partial" group destruction qualifies?
- Does the distinction between genocide and crimes against humanity matter morally or practically?

### ICC Effectiveness and Head-of-State Immunity

**The Al-Bashir case has become central to debates on international criminal justice**:

**Key legal questions**:
1. Does customary international law permit arrest of sitting heads of state for atrocity crimes?
2. Can the UN Security Council override traditional immunity rules?
3. What are the limits of ICC jurisdiction over non-member states?

**Criticisms**:
- **Enforcement failure**: Bashir traveled to numerous member states without arrest
- **African Union resistance**: Adopted non-cooperation resolutions; argued ICC shows anti-African bias (most cases involve African nations)
- **UN Security Council inaction**: Failed to take action on findings of non-compliance
- **Peace vs. justice debate**: Did the indictment undermine peace efforts in Sudan?

**Supporters argue**:
- The indictment symbolically delegitimized Bashir internationally
- It constrained his international travel
- It established principle that heads of state cannot escape accountability
- It documented crimes for historical record

**Ongoing relevance**: The ICC's recent warrants against Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu have revived these debates and tested whether the Bashir precedent applies universally.

## 12. Regional Comparisons

### Similarities to Other African Authoritarian Regimes

| Aspect | Bashir (Sudan) | [[ethiopia-mengistu|Mengistu (Ethiopia)]] | [[libya-gaddafi|Gaddafi (Libya)]] | [[somalia-barre|Barre (Somalia)]] |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Rise** | Military coup | Military coup | Military coup | Military coup |
| **Ideology** | Islamism | Marxism-Leninism | Revolutionary socialism/"Third Universal Theory" | "Scientific socialism" |
| **Duration** | 30 years | 17 years | 42 years | 22 years |
| **Mass atrocities** | Darfur genocide | Red Terror | Massacres, torture | Clan-based violence |
| **ICC/international prosecution** | First sitting head indicted | Convicted in absentia (Ethiopia) | Killed during uprising | Died in exile |
| **Fall** | Military coup after protests | Rebel victory | NATO intervention + rebels | Clan-based rebellion |

### Comparative Lessons

**Bashir's regime demonstrates**:
1. **Fragmented security sectors can delay but not prevent regime collapse**: The deliberate balancing of SAF, NISS, RSF, and militias prolonged Bashir's rule but created the factions that now tear Sudan apart
2. **International indictments do not guarantee accountability**: 16 years after the first warrant, Bashir remains uncharged before the ICC
3. **Ideology can be instrumentalized**: Islamism served regime consolidation rather than genuine religious goals
4. **Peace agreements that exclude key regions fail**: The CPA's omission of Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile perpetuated conflict
5. **Militia forces created for counterinsurgency become autonomous threats**: The Janjaweed-to-RSF evolution now challenges state survival

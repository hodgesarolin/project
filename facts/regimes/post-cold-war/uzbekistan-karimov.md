# Islam Karimov's Uzbekistan (1991-2016)

Islam Abduganiyevich Karimov (30 January 1938 - 2 September 2016) ruled Uzbekistan for 27 years, first as Communist Party First Secretary from 1989, then as President from independence in 1991 until his death in 2016. His regime became the most repressive in Central Asia, characterized by systematic torture, rigged elections, forced labor, and the brutal suppression of all political and religious opposition.

## 1. Pre-Conditions: Soviet Uzbekistan

### Cotton Monoculture and Economic Dependency

Uzbekistan's fate as an authoritarian state was shaped by Soviet economic policies that transformed the region into a cotton monoculture economy:

- By 1932, approximately three-fourths of the republic's farm households had been gathered into collective farms, with cotton farming greatly expanded at the expense of food crops[^1]
- Uzbekistan became the leading cotton producer in the Soviet Union, generating significant profits for the Soviet state at the cost of agricultural diversity[^2]
- The cotton strategy led to environmental catastrophe: overuse of water from the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers for irrigation contributed to the desiccation of the Aral Sea, once the fourth largest freshwater lake in the world, which has lost about 90% of its original size since the 1960s[^3][^4]

### The Cotton Scandal (Uzbek Cotton Affair)

- A massive corruption scandal exposed in 1983 revealed systematic falsification of cotton production quotas involving thousands of state and party cadres[^5]
- Uzbek Communist Party leader Sharaf Rashidov died (possibly suicide) before facing trial[^6]
- The scandal resulted in extensive purges of the Uzbek elite and provoked disaffection with Moscow among Uzbek leadership[^7]
- Karimov later rehabilitated Rashidov as a symbol of Uzbek nationalism, leading to growth of Uzbek national consciousness[^8]

### Karimov's Soviet Career

- Karimov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1964 after starting his career as an engineer[^9]
- Joined the State Planning Committee (Gosplan) of the Uzbek SSR in 1966 as a specialist in industrial planning[^10]
- Spent two decades advancing through Gosplan, gaining expertise in balancing local agricultural outputs with union-wide quotas - a process often marred by falsified reporting to meet Moscow's demands[^11]

---

## 2. Rise to Power (1989-1995)

### Appointment as First Secretary (1989)

- In June 1989, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev appointed Karimov as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan after his predecessor Rafiq Nishonov failed to quell inter-ethnic clashes and instability in the Fergana Region[^12]
- On 24 March 1990, elected first President of the Uzbek SSR by the Supreme Soviet[^13]
- From 1990-1991, served as member of the Central Committee and Politburo of the CPSU[^14]

### Independence Declaration (1991)

- On 31 August 1991, ten days after the attempted coup in Moscow, Karimov declared Uzbekistan independent - the second Central Asian state to do so after Kyrgyzstan[^15]
- Karimov seized the opportunity to cement his position as the first president of an independent Uzbekistan[^16]

### 1991 Presidential Election

- Direct presidential elections held 29 December 1991 alongside an independence referendum[^17]
- Karimov won with 86% of the vote against opposition candidate Muhammad Salih of the Erk (Freedom) Party, who received 12.3%[^18]
- Voter turnout reported at 94%[^19]
- The major opposition party Birlik had been refused registration in time for the election[^20]
- **This was the only presidential election in Uzbekistan to feature a genuine opposition candidate**[^21]

### Consolidation Through Referendums

- **1995 Referendum**: A few months before his term was due to expire, Karimov's term was extended until 2000 through referendum with 99.6% approval[^22]
- Subsequently "re-elected" in 2000, 2007, and 2015, each time receiving over 90% of the vote in elections widely regarded as rigged[^23]

---

## 3. Methods of Control

### Suppression of Political Opposition

From the moment Karimov took power, political repression defined his rule:

- Beginning in 1992, Karimov waged a campaign to eradicate all political opposition through politically motivated arrests, beatings, and harassment[^24]
- Targeted secular political groups including:
  - **Birlik** ("Unity") party
  - **Erk** ("Freedom"/"Will") Democratic Party
  - **Islamic Renaissance Party**
  - **Adolat** ("Justice")
  - **Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan**[^25]
- Muhammad Salih, Karimov's 1991 opponent, was forced to flee the country and sentenced in absentia to 15.5 years in prison for alleged involvement in 1999 Tashkent bombings[^26]
- All opposition parties were banned; Karimov labeled virtually all opponents as "Islamist radicals"[^27]

### The SNB (National Security Service)

The SNB (later renamed SGB) became the primary instrument of political repression:

- Described by Amnesty International and the Institute for War and Peace Reporting as a "secret police force"[^28]
- Headed by Rustam Inoyatov from 1995 to 2018, who oversaw human rights atrocities including the Andijan massacre[^29]
- Police and SNB routinely used torture as an investigation technique[^30]
- Members of opposition groups harassed as far away as Moscow[^31]
- Inoyatov was placed under EU sanctions for his role in the Andijan killings and imprisonment of thousands of political and religious prisoners[^32]

### Rigged Elections

Every election after 1991 was a sham:

- 1995: Term extension referendum with 99.6% approval
- 2000: "Re-elected" with over 90% of the vote
- 2007: "Re-elected" again with similar margins
- 2015: Won with 90.39% of the vote
- Elections featured only token opposition candidates loyal to the regime[^33]

## 4. The Andijan Massacre (May 13, 2005)

### Background and Events

The Andijan massacre stands as the defining atrocity of Karimov's regime:

**Precipitating Events**:
- Before dawn on May 13, 2005, armed men broke into the prison in Andijan, a city in the Fergana Valley in eastern Uzbekistan[^34]
- The gunmen freed 23 local businessmen who had been convicted of "religious extremism"[^35]
- Throughout the day, thousands of unarmed peaceful protesters (up to 10,000) gathered in the city's main square to speak out against poverty, unemployment, and government repression[^36]

**The Massacre**:
- Government forces in armored vehicles and snipers fired indiscriminately on the crowd[^37]
- Security forces blocked off the square as people attempted to flee[^38]
- Eyewitness account: "There was screaming, the women especially were crying, 'Don't shoot, don't shoot!' And the shooting continued for about half an hour"[^39]
- Government troops moved through the square executing wounded people where they lay[^40]
- Human Rights Watch described the killing as so extensive and indiscriminate that it "can best be described as a massacre"[^41]

### Death Toll Estimates

| Source | Estimated Deaths |
|--------|-----------------|
| Uzbek Government (official) | 187 |
| Human Rights Watch | 300-400 |
| Opposition political parties | 745 |
| SNB defector Ikrom Yakubov | 1,500 |
| Open Society Foundations | 500+ on May 13; 200+ on May 14 |

The SNB defector alleged that President Karimov himself ordered the troops to fire on the protesters[^42]

### Human Rights Watch Findings

- Field investigation found no evidence that protesters or gunmen had an Islamist agenda[^43]
- Interviews revealed protesters spoke about economic conditions, government repression, and unfair trials - not the creation of an Islamic state[^44]
- The Uzbek government rejected all efforts to allow an independent inquiry[^45]

### International Reaction

**EU Response**:
- October 3, 2005: EU imposed sanctions including partial suspension of Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, visa ban on 12 officials, and arms embargo[^46]
- Beginning 2006: EU weakened sanctions despite no Uzbek compliance
- 2009: EU lifted remaining sanctions and dropped call for international investigation[^47]

**US Response**:
- Tightened restrictions on military assistance[^48]
- Congress restricted assistance based on human rights record[^49]
- Visa ban on Uzbek officials implemented in 2008[^50]
- January 2012: Obama administration waived restrictions on military aid[^51]

**Russia and China**:
- Supported the Uzbek government's response
- Blocked international investigation through their influence[^52]

## 5. Human Rights Violations

### Systematic Torture

Torture was endemic and systematic under Karimov's rule, documented extensively by international organizations:

#### Documented Torture Methods:
- Electric shocks
- Sexual assault
- Pulling out fingernails and toenails
- Long stints of solitary confinement without food or drink
- Beating, breaking of limbs
- Smashing teeth
- Pulling away skin with pliers
- **Immersion in boiling water**[^53][^54]

#### The Boiling Alive Cases

The most horrific documented cases involved prisoners being boiled to death:

- **Muzafar Avazov and Husnidin Alimov**: Classified as "religious prisoners"
- According to Human Rights Watch, 60-70% of Avazov's body was burned
- Doctors who examined the body reported "such burns could only have been caused by immersing Avazov in boiling water"[^55]
- Avazov also had a bloody wound on the back of his head, heavy bruising, and his fingernails had been removed[^56]
- Former British Ambassador Craig Murray reported this was "not an isolated incident"[^57]

#### Jaslyk Prison ("House of Torture")

- Opened in 1999 on a former Soviet chemical weapons testing site near the dried Aral Sea[^58]
- Dubbed the "House of Torture" and the "Place of No Return"[^59]
- Former inmates recalled: electric shocks, sexual assault, pulling out fingernails, and long solitary confinement[^60]
- Poet and dissident Yusuf Juma, who spent three years there: "I don't know which is worse - Jaslyk or Nazi concentration camps during World War II... Jaslyk is nothing less than a death camp"[^61]
- Rights activist Azam Farmonov, imprisoned 12 years: "Jaslyk was a real hell for prisoners. They were beaten on their heels with rubber batons. They hung them from frames with handcuffs"[^62]
- **Closed by President Mirziyoyev in August 2019** - fulfilling a demand UN bodies first made 17 years earlier[^63]

### Forced Labor in Cotton Harvest

The cotton harvest represented one of the world's largest forced labor systems:

- Over 2 million laborers mobilized annually - the world's largest seasonal labor mobilization[^64]
- Each autumn, the state organized "mass mobilization" mandating involvement of children, university students, teachers, and civil servants[^65]
- Refusal meant fines, loss of employment, or expulsion from school[^66]
- Children removed from classrooms and placed in fields under hazardous conditions, often unpaid[^67]

#### ILO Monitoring (2014-2021)

- 2014: Global pressure forced Karimov to allow ILO monitoring[^68]
- ILO found about one-third of 2.8 million cotton pickers were "non-voluntary"[^69]
- Universities across the country essentially closed so students could pick cotton for a month[^70]
- 2014 harvest: 17 people died, including two children (ages 3 and 5) who died in a house fire after being left alone while their mother picked cotton[^71]

#### Post-Karimov Reforms

- Mirziyoyev committed to ending forced labor
- 2021: ILO reported 99% of workers voluntary[^72]
- 2022: ILO declared systematic forced labor eliminated[^73]
- Cotton Campaign lifted boycott pledge in March 2022[^74]

### Religious Persecution

#### Persecution of Muslims

Karimov's regime conducted systematic persecution of independent religious expression:

- **1998 Law on Religion**: One of the world's most restrictive, outlawing most forms of public or independent worship[^75]
- Any Muslim who prayed privately, studied Islam, prayed five times daily, observed religious holidays, learned Arabic, or wore a beard or headscarf could be labeled an "extremist"[^76]
- By end of 2003: Nearly 6,000 people imprisoned on political or religious grounds, according to Memorial[^77]
- Estimated 7,000 people arrested, tortured, and incarcerated in grossly inhumane conditions[^78]
- Karimov "exploited the struggle against terrorism to justify mass arrests of observant Muslims"[^79]

#### Persecution of Christians

- Unregistered religious activity illegal, incurring fines up to 300 times minimum monthly wage and up to 5 years imprisonment[^80]
- Christians belonging to non-registered churches suffered police raids, threats, arrests, and fines[^81]
- House churches met under secret service surveillance[^82]
- Muslim converts to Christianity faced persecution from both state and families[^83]

### Media Censorship and Imprisoned Journalists

- Security agents enforced rigid, Soviet-style prior censorship[^84]
- Government monopolized printing presses and newspaper distribution[^85]
- Critical coverage of Karimov and his family forbidden[^86]
- **Muhammad Bekjanov and Yusuf Ruzimuradov**: Journalists jailed in 1999 for 14 and 15 years respectively - the world's longest imprisoned journalists[^87]
- Ruzimuradov released February 2018 after 19 years - the longest imprisonment of any journalist worldwide[^88]
- Bekjanov's sentence arbitrarily extended just days before scheduled release[^89]

---

## 6. Response to Islamic Militancy

### The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU)

- Founded 1998 by Tahir Yuldashev and former Soviet paratrooper Juma Namangani[^90]
- Original objective: Overthrow Karimov and create an Islamic state under Sharia[^91]
- Later became an Al-Qaeda ally, receiving substantial funding from Osama bin Laden[^92]
- Established base in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan after Karimov's 1998 crackdown[^93]

### 1999 Tashkent Bombings

- February 16, 1999: Five simultaneous car bombs in Tashkent, one nearly killing Karimov[^94]
- Government blamed IMU (not independently verified)[^95]
- Karimov initially accused Hizb ut-Tahrir, leading to mass arrests and torture of Muslims[^96]

### Hizb ut-Tahrir

- Trans-national organization seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate through non-violent means[^97]
- Karimov treated suspected members more harshly than ordinary criminals[^98]
- Credible reports of particularly severe interrogation including torture in pretrial detention[^99]
- Common criminals paid or induced to beat Hizb ut-Tahrir members in prison[^100]

### Scope of Crackdown

- Human Rights Watch estimated over 6,000 Uzbeks imprisoned for practicing Islam outside state-run establishment by 2004[^101]
- Government response escalated Karimov's suppression of Islam, particularly in the Fergana Valley[^102]
- Repression increased recruitment for the IMU[^103]

---

## 7. Economic Policy

### The "Karimov Model"

Karimov outlined his economic philosophy in *Uzbekistan: Its Own Model for Transition to a Market Economy*, based on five principles:
1. Freeing the economy of ideology
2. The state as the main reformer
3. Rule of law
4. Strong social policy
5. Gradual reform to adapt to market[^104]

### State Control

- Cotton and gold jointly accounted for more than two-thirds of export revenues in the early 1990s[^105]
- State marketing monopoly ensured substantial cotton revenues went to government[^106]
- Land privatization incomplete: small producers received only 20% of available land[^107]
- Government dictated what private landowners could plant, to whom they could sell, and set below-cost purchase prices[^108]

### Currency and Trade Controls

- Currency conversion restricted under Karimov[^109]
- Imports controlled; borders with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan sporadically closed[^110]
- 1996: Falling cotton prices led to strict exchange controls
- Substantial black market emerged for foreign currency[^111]

### Economic Performance (Disputed)

Official statistics (questionable reliability):
- Average annual growth rate of 5% (1996-2016)[^112]
- Growth of over 8% (2004-2016)[^113]
- First Soviet successor state to regain pre-1991 GDP level by end of 1990s[^114]
- GDP reportedly tripled since early 1990s[^115]

Reality:
- Official inflation figures widely considered unreliable (Karimov claimed 5.6% in 2015; Western estimates were twice as high)[^116]
- Uzbekistan lacked reliable poverty data, making social performance comparison impossible[^117]
- Millions of Uzbek migrant workers abroad suggested economic conditions worse than official figures[^118]

### Poverty

- Official statistics showed poverty declining from 27.5% (2001) to 17.7% (2012)[^119]
- Rural real incomes stagnated at best[^120]
- Poverty reportedly increased in some regions, particularly Karakalpakstan[^121]

---

## 8. Foreign Policy

### Early US Alliance and the K2 Air Base

- After 9/11, Uzbekistan became first Central Asian country to join the anti-terror alliance[^122]
- US secured basing rights at Karshi-Khanabad (K2) Air Base near the Afghan border at no cost[^123]
- 7,000 US personnel stationed there 2001-2005 during Operation Enduring Freedom[^124]

### Extraordinary Rendition

Uzbekistan participated in the CIA's post-9/11 "extraordinary rendition" program:

- One of 54 nations that cooperated with CIA according to "Globalizing Torture" report[^125]
- CIA-operated flights tracked in and out of Tashkent from October 2001 to June 2005[^126]
- Former British Ambassador Craig Murray exposed that CIA brought prisoners knowing Uzbeks would use torture[^127]
- Murray testified: "The Uzbeks very regularly used very brutal torture. A lot of beating, breaking of limbs... pulling away skin with pliers, pulling out fingernails and toenails"[^128]
- Karimov described as "very much George Bush's man in Central Asia" - no Bush administration official ever criticized him publicly[^129]

### K2 Expulsion After Andijan (2005)

The Andijan massacre triggered a fundamental shift:

- June 2005: Karimov curtailed US operations in retaliation for American criticism[^130]
- Prohibited nighttime operations and limited heavy transport aircraft[^131]
- Greatest source of irritation: US airlift of Andijan refugees from Kyrgyzstan[^132]
- July 29, 2005: Uzbekistan invoked 180-day termination clause[^133]
- November 21, 2005: US withdrawal completed[^134]

### Russia/China Pivot

- 2005: Uzbekistan signed mutual defense pact with Russia for closer military cooperation[^135]
- Chinese and Russian support allowed Uzbekistan to avoid international investigation[^136]
- Karimov pursued "self-reliance" policy, isolating the country from both West and, periodically, Russia[^137]
- Pulled Uzbekistan out of Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization in 2012[^138]
- Refused to join Eurasian Economic Union[^139]
- Oscillated between Washington, Moscow, and Beijing, finding support in different capitals at different times[^140]

### Regional Tensions

- Borders with neighbors sporadically closed[^141]
- Relations complicated by water disputes (Aral Sea crisis), border demarcation issues, and ethnic tensions
- Karimov opposed Russian intervention in Kyrgyzstan, aligning with China in the SCO[^142]

---

## 9. Succession and Post-Karimov Era

### Karimov's Death (September 2016)

- August 29, 2016: Karimov suffered cerebral hemorrhage[^143]
- September 2, 2016: Official death date (widely speculated he actually died August 27)[^144]
- No succession planning in place; his sudden death created "real anxiety" for the country and region[^145]

### Power Transition

Three potential successors:
1. Prime Minister **Shavkat Mirziyoyev**
2. First Deputy PM/Finance Minister **Rustam Azimov**
3. SNB chief **Rustam Inoyatov**[^146]

- Mirziyoyev was appointed head of funeral organizing committee - a symbolic Soviet-era signal of succession[^147]
- December 4, 2016: Mirziyoyev elected president with 88.61% of the vote[^148]
- First change of power in Uzbekistan's post-Soviet history[^149]

### Mirziyoyev Reforms

**Positive Changes**:
- Released over 50 political prisoners including world's longest-imprisoned journalists[^150]
- Closed Jaslyk prison in 2019[^151]
- March 2018: Transferred SNB responsibilities to other ministries; dismissed SNB chief Inoyatov; renamed SNB to State Security Service (SGB)[^152]
- Removed over 20,000 citizens from security services "blacklists"[^153]
- Stopped applying Article 221 (arbitrary sentence extensions)[^154]
- Liberalized currency in 2017[^155]
- Ended systematic forced labor in cotton harvest by 2021[^156]
- Improved relations with neighboring states[^157]

**Ongoing Concerns**:
- Thousands remain imprisoned on vague "extremism" charges[^158]
- No political prisoner has been formally exonerated[^159]
- No opposition parties operate legally[^160]
- Legislature and judiciary remain executive instruments[^161]
- Media still tightly controlled[^162]
- No accountability for Andijan massacre or other Karimov-era crimes[^163]

---

## 10. Legacy and Regime Classification

### The Most Repressive Central Asian State

Under Karimov, Uzbekistan became "the archetypal post-Soviet police state: corrupt, brutal, and defiantly inward-looking"[^164]:

- Banned all unregistered religious activity (1998)
- Expelled nearly all foreign NGOs (2005-2006)
- Blocked access to social media platforms
- Kidnapped dissidents and delivered them secretly to prisons
- Assassinated exiles in countries including Sweden and Turkey[^165]

### Torture as Systematic Policy

Craig Murray summarized: "Torture has been endemic in Uzbekistan, where Karimov banned all opposition groups, severely restricted freedom of expression, and suppressed religious freedom. Thousands of dissidents have been jailed and many hundreds have been killed, some of them literally boiled alive"[^166]

### Cult of Personality

Unlike neighboring Turkmenistan, Karimov avoided ubiquitous portraits and statues during his lifetime[^167]. However:

- Known popularly as "ota" (father) and in Fergana as "podsho" (padishah/sultan)[^168]
- 2003: His writings became core of national curriculum[^169]
- **After death**: Cult mushroomed - monuments erected, marble-clad mausoleum with gilded walls built in Samarkand[^170]
- Museum featuring 35+ portraits and bronze sculptures opened[^171]
- 2018: Signs of retreat - instructions given not to mention Karimov on state TV; portraits removed from buildings[^172]

---

## Scholarly Debates: Regime Classification

### Sultanistic Regime

The scholarly literature characterizes Karimov's Uzbekistan as a "sultanistic regime" following the theoretical framework of H. Chehabi and J.J. Linz:

- **Sultanistic characteristics**: Personal rule, absence of ideology beyond leader's survival, use of the state as personal instrument, arbitrary use of power, extensive use of rewards and punishments[^173]
- Karimov's death "marked the beginning of profound changes associated with the transformation of the sultanistic regime"[^174]

### Neopatrimonial State

Scholars also classify Uzbekistan as a "neopatrimonial authoritarian regime":

- High degree of autonomy from outside influence
- Excessive centralization of power under personalist dictatorship[^175]
- Blending of public office with personal rule
- Patron-client networks as basis of power[^176]

### Totalitarian vs. Authoritarian

Debate exists over whether Karimov's rule was:

- **Neo-Stalinist/Totalitarian**: Some argue it resembled Soviet-era patrimonialistic governance that was "even abandoned in Putin's Russia or Lukashenko's Belarus"[^177]
- **Sultanistic Authoritarian**: Others emphasize the personalist, non-ideological nature distinct from classic totalitarianism[^178]
- **Comparative Context**: Similar personalization of power seen in [[kazakhstan-nazarbayev]], [[turkmenistan-niyazov]], and [[tajikistan-rahmon]], forming a pattern of Central Asian "constitutional autocracies"[^179]

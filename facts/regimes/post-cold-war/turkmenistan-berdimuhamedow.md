# Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow: The Arkadag Era in Turkmenistan (2006-2022)

## Overview

Gurbanguly Mälikgulyýewiç Berdimuhamedow (born June 29, 1957) is a Turkmen politician and former dentist who served as the second President of Turkmenistan from 2007 to 2022. Rising to power after the sudden death of Saparmurat Niyazov, Berdimuhamedow initially raised hopes of reform but instead maintained and adapted the totalitarian system he inherited. Known by his self-styled title "Arkadag" (The Protector), he developed his own elaborate personality cult while presiding over one of the world's most repressive and isolated states. In 2022, he engineered Central Asia's first modern dynastic succession by handing power to his son Serdar, while retaining enormous influence as "National Leader" and chairman of the upper legislative chamber.

**Key characteristics of the Berdimuhamedow regime:**
- Continuation of totalitarian control with superficial reforms
- Development of a comprehensive personality cult rivaling his predecessor
- Obsessive promotion of Akhal-Teke horses and Alabai dogs
- Bizarre propaganda videos featuring stunts, music, and athletics
- Near-total dependence on natural gas exports to China
- Hidden economic crisis despite enormous energy wealth
- First dynastic succession in post-Soviet Central Asia
- Continued enforced disappearances and political repression

---

## 1. Pre-Conditions: Niyazov's Death and Succession Crisis

### The Death of Turkmenbashi

On the afternoon of December 21, 2006, Turkmen state television announced that President Saparmurat Niyazov had died of a sudden heart attack in the early morning hours at approximately 01:10 local time at his residence, the Turkmenbashy Palace, at age 66. [^1] One month prior to his death, Niyazov had publicly announced that he had been taking heart medication for several years for an unidentified cardiac condition. [^2]

Niyazov's death left Turkmenistan "rudderless, without clear political succession." [^3] He had simultaneously held the posts of president, prime minister, armed forces commander in chief, and head of the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan - the only registered political party. [^4]

### The Constitutional Crisis

The constitution mandated that parliamentary speaker Owezgeldi Atayew (Ovezgeldy Atayev) would assume the presidency. However, events unfolded differently:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| December 21, 2006 | Niyazov's death announced |
| December 21, 2006 | Atayew arrested and charged with abuse of power and human rights violations |
| December 21, 2006 | Berdimuhamedow named acting president and head of funeral commission |
| December 26, 2006 | Halk Maslahaty announces early presidential elections for February 11, 2007 |

According to the International Crisis Group: "After Niyazov's death, a group centering on Berdimuhamedov, the deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Rejepov, chief of the Presidential Guard, took what appears to be an uncontested hold on power." [^5]

### The Inheritance

Niyazov bequeathed a country facing severe challenges:
- Ruined education and public health sectors
- A record of severe human rights abuses
- Thousands of political prisoners
- An economy under strain despite rich energy exports
- One of the world's most isolated information environments [^6]

---

## 2. Rise to Power

### Background: The Dentist Who Became President

Berdimuhamedow's career trajectory was unusual even by Central Asian standards:

**Education and Early Career:**
- Trained as a dentist, graduating from the Turkmen State Medical Institute in 1979 [^7]
- Served as the personal dentist to President Niyazov - a position that gave him unparalleled access to power [^8]
- Appointed Minister of Health from 1997 to 2001
- Became Deputy Prime Minister in charge of health, education, and science in 2001 [^9]

### The February 2007 Election

The presidential election held on February 11, 2007 was "carefully choreographed" with "genuine regime opponents excluded":

- **Result**: Berdimuhamedow won with approximately 89% of the vote [^10]
- **Candidates**: Six candidates ran, all members of the ruling Democratic Party
- **International reaction**: Widely criticized as neither free nor fair
- **Opposition status**: The political opposition was mostly in exile, and Niyazov's biological children were sidelined [^11]

As the election approached, there was "little doubt" about the outcome - Berdimuhamedow's victory was preordained. [^12]

---

## 3. Methods of Control

### Security Apparatus

Turkmenistan's repressive apparatus remained largely intact from the Niyazov era:

**Ministry for National Security (MNS):**
- The secret police agency, composed largely of remnants of Soviet KGB organs
- Known as the KNB (Committee for National Security) until 2002
- Functions remain largely the same as under Soviet rule [^13]

**Surveillance Methods:**
According to the U.S. State Department, the state security apparatus "regularly monitors the activities of officials, citizens, opponents, critics of the government, and foreigners" using:
- Physical surveillance
- Telephone tapping
- Electronic eavesdropping
- Networks of informers [^14]

**The Presidential Security Service** operates as a second secret police organization, sometimes at odds with the MNS. [^15]

### Information Control

Turkmenistan maintains one of the world's most restrictive information environments:

**Internet Censorship:**
- Listed as one of the few "Internet enemies" by Reporters Without Borders since 2006 [^16]
- More than 122,000 domains censored
- YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, Discord, Signal, and Telegram all blocked [^17]
- Less than 30% of the population has internet access
- Average broadband speed of just 3.72 Mbps (global average exceeds 100 Mbps) [^18]

**State Monopoly:**
The state-owned provider Turkmentelecom holds a monopoly over internet services, controlling all fixed broadband and mobile data networks. [^19]

**Oath Requirement:**
Turkmenistan residents "are asked to swear on the Quran not to use circumvention tools while signing up for a home internet connection." [^20]

### Press Freedom

Turkmenistan ranked 174th out of 180 countries in the 2025 World Press Freedom Index, rated "worst globally for political context." [^21] The country is consistently listed alongside North Korea and Eritrea as having the least press freedom in the world. [^22]

---

## 4. The Personality Cult: Arkadag and Beyond

### The "Arkadag" Title

Berdimuhamedow developed his own comprehensive personality cult to replace that of his predecessor:

- **2010**: Acquired the title "Arkadag" (The Protector) during Flag Day celebrations
- **2011**: The title spread nationwide through poems, songs, billboards, posters, and propaganda [^23]
- The Council of Elders formally bestowed the title upon him [^24]

> "Niyazov's cult is gradually being replaced with Berdymukhamedov's: The current president likes to be called Arkadag ('Protector') and he stares down on his subjects from portraits plastered all over the country, including in airplanes and taxis." [^25]

### Statues and Monuments

**The Golden Horse Statue (2015):**
In May 2015, a huge marble and gold statue was unveiled featuring Berdimuhamedow on horseback while holding aloft a dove. The six-meter statue sits atop a white marble cliff at a major Ashgabat intersection. [^26]

**The Golden Alabai Statue (2020):**
On November 10, 2020, Berdimuhamedow unveiled a 6-meter (20 ft) gilded statue of an Alabai dog on a 9-meter pedestal. According to state media, the president "came up with the idea for the monument and oversaw its construction himself." The statue features a wraparound LED screen showing footage of real Alabai dogs. [^27]

**Arkadag City (2023):**
On June 29, 2023 (Berdimuhamedow's birthday), authorities unveiled Arkadag, a $5 billion "smart city" named after the former president:
- Designed for 73,000 residents
- All buildings painted white
- All residential buildings exactly seven stories high
- Only electric vehicles permitted
- Full 5G coverage
- Features a 43-meter monument of Berdimuhamedow [^28]

### The Horse Obsession

Berdimuhamedow's affection for Akhal-Teke horses became legendary:

- Authored two books: *"The Flight of Celestial Race Horses"* and *"Akhal-Teke - Our Pride and Glory"*
- Launched the government website "Heavenly Akhal-Teke Horses"
- Established annual horse beauty contests
- Fired the head of the national equine association for insufficient promotion of the breed
- Owns approximately 10% of the world's population of Akhal-Tekes [^29]
- Turkmenistan is the only country in the world with a Ministry of Horses [^30]

**The Horse Fall Incident (2013):**
During a race on April 28, 2013, Berdimuhamedow won an $11 million purse, but immediately after crossing the finish line on his horse "Berkarar" (Mighty), he was thrown face-first onto the track. He "lies motionless face down in the race track sands for several seconds before dozens of black-suited officials rush to help." State media showed only the victory, not the fall. Authorities at Ashgabat airport "made intensive checks of passengers leaving the country in search of phones, tablets and cameras with footage of the incident." [^31]

### Propaganda Stunts and Videos

Berdimuhamedow regularly appeared in bizarre state propaganda:

- **Weightlifting**: Performed in front of his applauding cabinet ministers [^32]
- **Rap music**: Released a rap video with his grandson in July 2018 titled "Sportly Turkmenistan" [^33]
- **DJing**: Appeared as a DJ at a 2020 New Year's party [^34]
- **Shooting**: Featured in videos firing various weapons
- **Car racing and knife-throwing**: Part of his "macho" public image [^35]

John Oliver's *Last Week Tonight* described Turkmenistan as "the vortex of weirdness." Political scientist Luca Anceschi called Berdimuhamedow "a megalomaniac... a guy who wants to be seen as an untouchable demigod." [^36]

### Family Involvement

The personality cult extended to family members:
- Unveiled a 5-meter bronze bust of his father Myalikguly Berdymukhamedov for the patriarch's 81st birthday [^37]
- His son Serdar chairs the International Alabai Association
- Grandsons appeared in propaganda videos alongside him

---

## 5. Modest Reforms: Reversing Niyazov's Absurdities

### The Initial Promise

Upon taking power, Berdimuhamedow reversed some of Niyazov's most extreme policies:

**Cultural Reforms (2008):**
- Lifted bans on circuses and opera (banned in 2001 as "unturkmen-like") [^38]
- Reopened ballet performances
- Allowed internet cafes (though state-monitored)
- Restored original names for months and days of the week [^39]

**Educational Reforms:**
- Extended compulsory education from nine to ten years
- Reintroduced classes in sports and foreign languages
- Announced plans for specialized arts schools [^40]

### The Reality

However, these reforms proved largely cosmetic:

> "Since December 2006, under Berdimuhamedow's government, no significant improvements regarding human rights and civil liberty have been observed by international human rights organizations." [^41]

**Internet Cafes - The Reality:**
While Berdimuhamedow brought internet access to Turkmenistan, "internet cafes are sparse and state-owned. Clerks write down users' identification details, and a video camera adorns every room. Certain websites known to turn a critical eye to the regime are inaccessible." [^42]

---

## 6. Continued Repression

### Enforced Disappearances

One of the most severe human rights violations continued under Berdimuhamedow:

- An estimated 162 people have been forcibly disappeared in Turkmen prisons
- At least 27 died in prison in solitary confinement
- 96 continuing enforced disappearances as of recent counts
- At least 33 individuals whose prison terms expired between 2017 and 2024 remain disappeared [^43]

The Prove They Are Alive campaign documents these cases, noting that some individuals have been disappeared for more than 20 years. [^44]

### Political Prisoners

Many individuals remain imprisoned on politically motivated charges, including:
- Human rights defender Mansur Mingelov (22-year sentence)
- Blogger Murat Dushemov
- Murad Ovezov
- Myalikberdy Allamuradov [^45]

### Transnational Repression

The regime extended its reach beyond borders:
- **2024**: Blogger Farkhad Meimankuliev deported from Turkey and sentenced to 18-22 years in Turkmenistan [^46]
- **October 2024**: Daud Kyarizov, a media editor with an exiled activist group, was beaten in Boston one week after his family publicized UN findings against Turkmenistan [^47]
- **April 2025**: Bloggers Alisher Sakhatov and Abdulla Orusov detained in Turkey at Turkmenistan's request; they later disappeared with unconfirmed reports of forcible return [^48]

### Freedom Ratings

Freedom House consistently rates Turkmenistan among the world's worst:
- Status: "Not Free"
- Turkmenistan "is a repressive authoritarian state where political rights and civil liberties are almost completely denied in practice" [^49]
- In 2025, the civil liberties score declined to 0 due to new restrictions on abortion, divorce, and public displays of affection [^50]

### Forced Labor

The cotton harvest continues to rely on state-imposed forced labor:
- An estimated 72,000 people living in "modern slavery" according to the 2023 Global Slavery Index [^51]
- Public sector workers face termination if they refuse to pick cotton or pay for a replacement [^52]
- The U.S. banned all Turkmenistan cotton products in 2018 due to findings of state-enforced slave labor [^53]
- Child labor persisted despite a 2024 official ban [^54]

### Exit Restrictions

Citizens face severe restrictions on foreign travel:
- "Black lists" prevent certain citizens from leaving the country [^55]
- The State Migration Service can block citizens from exiting for up to five years after deportation from abroad [^56]

---

## 7. Economic Issues

### Gas Dependency

Turkmenistan's economy is built almost entirely on natural gas:

**The Galkynysh Field:**
- The world's second-largest gas field
- Estimated reserves of 27.4 trillion cubic meters
- Discovered in 2006, production started in 2013 [^57]
- CNPC (China) controls 82% (14.4 tcm) of Turkmenistan's proven gas reserves through service contracts [^58]

**Export Infrastructure:**
| Pipeline | Capacity | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Central Asia-China (Lines A, B, C) | 55 bcm/year | Operational |
| Line D | Additional 30 bcm/year | Under construction |
| TAPI (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India) | 33 bcm/year | Under construction |

China has purchased over 300 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Turkmenistan since 2009. [^59]

### Collapse of Diversification

Turkmenistan lost its other major customers:
- **Russia**: Gazprom stopped purchases in 2016, resuming only in 2019 with modest volumes of 5.5 bcm/year - for political rather than economic reasons [^60]
- **Iran**: Gas cut off in 2017 after payment disputes; an international court ordered Iran to pay $2 billion to Ashgabat [^61]

This left China as essentially Turkmenistan's only major gas customer.

### Hidden Poverty

Despite enormous energy wealth, Turkmenistan faces a severe hidden economic crisis:

**Official vs. Reality:**
- Official poverty rate: 0.2%
- Independent estimates: 33-45% of the population below the poverty line [^62]
- Official unemployment: 4-5%
- Estimated real unemployment: 40-50% (10x official figures) [^63]

**Food Crisis:**
- Food shortages began in 2016 after gas prices collapsed
- People queue for hours to access subsidized bread, "often being turned away empty-handed" [^64]
- Some citizens resort to "rummaging through garbage bins looking for something to sell, usually plastic for recycling, or for food scraps" [^65]

**Unreliable Data:**
International institutions classify Turkmenistan as "upper-middle income" based on government data, but diplomats and multilateral agency staff told Human Rights Watch that "government economic data was notoriously unreliable." Analysts describe a "Potemkin economy" where "respectable official GDP figures mask a chaotic, black financial system." [^66]

---

## 8. The 2022 Dynastic Succession

### Preparation

The succession was carefully engineered over many years:

**2016 Constitutional Amendment:**
- Removed the 70-year age cap for presidential candidates
- Extended presidential terms from 5 to 7 years
- Removed term limits
- The reforms "effectively allowed President Berdymuhamedov to extend his reign indefinitely" [^67]

**Grooming the Heir:**
- Serdar Berdimuhamedow (born 1981) was groomed for at least a decade
- The constitution was amended to lower the age limit to 40 - a threshold Serdar reached in 2021 [^68]
- Serdar held various positions including deputy governor, industry minister, and deputy prime minister

### The 2022 Election

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| February 12, 2022 | Early election announced (originally due 2024) |
| March 12, 2022 | Election held |
| March 14, 2022 | Serdar declared winner with 72.97% |
| March 19, 2022 | Inauguration at Ruhyyet Palace |

**Election Integrity:**
According to unofficial reports, "administrators were required to spend the entire night changing ballots in districts where Serdar had not been selected by voters. Ballot stuffing, mis-recording of votes, and other vote-rigging practices were reportedly on full display." [^69]

**Historical Significance:**
This made Turkmenistan "the first modern country in Central Asia to be ruled by a dynastic system." [^70]

### Why the Early Transition?

The timing may have been influenced by events in Kazakhstan in January 2022, when former president Nursultan Nazarbayev "was deprived of his functions" during political unrest. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow may have sought to secure the dynasty before similar instability could threaten his family's hold on power. [^71]

---

## 9. Current Status: The "National Leader"

### The Power-Sharing Arrangement

Rather than fully retiring, Berdimuhamedow retained enormous power:

**January 21, 2023 Reforms:**
- The People's Council (Halk Maslahaty) transformed from upper legislative chamber to "the country's top governing body"
- Berdimuhamedow appointed permanent chairman
- Granted the title "National Leader of the Turkmen People" (Milli Lider)
- The parliament restructured from bicameral to unicameral [^72]

**Powers of the "National Leader":**
- Right to speak on any public matter
- Immunity from prosecution (extending to family members)
- Personal protection by national security agencies
- Lifetime financial support from the government [^73]

### Continued Personality Cult

The elder Berdimuhamedow's personality cult reached "new heights" in 2023 with the unveiling of Arkadag city, "a multibillion-dollar city that glorifies his persona." [^74]

### The Father-Son Dynamic

Observers describe a "power-sharing arrangement" where "they jointly rule a totalitarian dictatorship." [^75] Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow's role as chairman of the Halk Maslahaty allows him "to oversee and directly influence state policy." [^76]

---

## 10. Scholarly Debates

### Sultanistic vs. Totalitarian Classification

Turkmenistan poses challenges for political scientists seeking to classify authoritarian regimes:

**Sultanistic Characteristics:**
Drawing on Juan Linz and H.E. Chehabi's framework, Turkmenistan exhibits classic sultanistic features:
- Extreme personalization of power
- Arbitrary rule based on the leader's whims
- Extensive personality cults
- Blurring of public and private spheres
- Dynastic succession tendencies

**Totalitarian Elements:**
The regime also displays characteristics associated with totalitarianism:
- Pervasive state control over all aspects of society
- Extensive surveillance apparatus (inherited from Soviet KGB)
- Ideological indoctrination (though personality cult rather than ideology)
- Closed borders and information control approaching North Korea's level

### Persistence of Authoritarianism

The succession to Serdar raises questions about authoritarian durability:
- **Personalist vulnerability**: Traditional theory suggests personalist regimes collapse when the leader dies
- **Turkmen exception**: The smooth Niyazov-to-Berdimuhamedow-to-Serdar transitions suggest institutionalization of repression
- **Kazakhstan comparison**: The January 2022 unrest that removed Nazarbayev from power may have accelerated Turkmenistan's dynastic transition as a preemptive measure

### Regional Comparisons

Turkmenistan represents an extreme within post-Soviet Central Asia:
- More isolated than [[kazakhstan-nazarbayev|Kazakhstan]]
- More personality-cult focused than [[uzbekistan-karimov|Uzbekistan under Karimov]]
- Information control approaching [[north-korea-kim-dynasty|North Korea]]
- First dynastic succession in the region, potentially influencing [[azerbaijan-aliyev|Azerbaijan's Aliyev dynasty]]

# Venezuela Under Nicolas Maduro (2013-Present)

## Overview

Nicolas Maduro's regime in Venezuela represents one of the most dramatic cases of state collapse and humanitarian catastrophe in modern Latin American history. Inheriting Hugo Chavez's Bolivarian Revolution in 2013, Maduro presided over an economic implosion that saw GDP fall by approximately 80%, hyperinflation reaching 1.7 million percent, and the exodus of nearly 8 million refugees---the largest displacement crisis outside of active warfare. The regime maintained power through systematic electoral manipulation, court-packing, violent repression, and support from [[cuba-castro|Cuba]], Russia, and China.

## 1. Pre-Conditions: The Chavez Legacy

### The Bolivarian Revolution (1999-2013)

Hugo Chavez came to power in 1998 after the Venezuelan political system, based on the Puntofijo Pact between traditional parties, had lost legitimacy following the [Caracazo uprising of 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracazo)---a week of riots against IMF-imposed austerity that killed an estimated 300-3,000 people.

**Institutional Transformation Under Chavez:**
- New constitution adopted in 1999 via referendum
- Creation of new legislature, supreme court, and electoral authorities
- Purges of armed forces and state-owned oil industry (PDVSA)
- Nationalization of key industries
- Social programs ("Bolivarian Missions") funded by oil revenues
- [Source: CFR - Venezuela's Chavez Era](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/venezuelas-chavez-era)

### Oil Dependency

Venezuela became the archetype of a "petro-state":
- Oil revenues funded 96% of export earnings
- Government spending tied directly to oil prices
- PDVSA became politicized, with technical experts replaced by loyalists
- [Source: CFR - Venezuela: Rise and Fall of a Petrostate](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/venezuela-crisis)

### Institutional Erosion

By Chavez's death in 2013:
- All major state institutions controlled by Chavistas
- Supreme Court packed with government allies
- National Electoral Council (CNE) stacked with supporters
- Independent media marginalized
- Military leadership personally loyal to the movement
- [Source: Britannica - Hugo Chavez Legacy](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugo-Chavez/Legacy)

## 2. Rise to Power (2013)

### Chavez's Death and Succession

- Hugo Chavez died March 5, 2013, from cancer

## 3. Methods of Control

### Supreme Court Packing

**2015 Lame-Duck Appointments:**
- Opposition won National Assembly supermajority in December 2015
- Outgoing pro-government Assembly packed Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ) with Maduro allies
- New tribunal stripped three opposition lawmakers of seats, preventing supermajority

### 2017 Constitutional Crisis

**March 2017 - Judicial Coup:**
- TSJ ruled National Assembly "in contempt"
- Court stripped Assembly of legislative powers and assumed them
- Opposition called it a "coup d'etat"
- International condemnation forced partial reversal
- [Source: Wikipedia - 2017 Venezuelan Constitutional Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Venezuelan_constitutional_crisis)

### 2017 Constituent Assembly

**Creation (May-August 2017):**
- Maduro called Constituent Assembly by decree (not referendum)
- Elections held July 30, 2017, boycotted by opposition
- Smartmatic (voting machine company) stated results were manipulated by at least 1 million votes
- Assembly declared itself supreme governing body
- Effectively nullified opposition-controlled National Assembly
- Over 40 countries refused recognition

### Electoral Manipulation

**Systematic Methods:**
- CNE controlled by government allies despite constitutional mandate for independence
- Opposition parties forced to repeatedly re-register
- Major parties (Popular Will, Justice First) banned from 2018 election
- Leading candidates (Leopoldo Lopez, Maria Corina Machado) barred from running
- "Tascon List" used to identify and punish opposition voters
- Gerrymandering and voter roll manipulation
- [Source: WOLA - Venezuela's Unfair Election](https://www.wola.org/analysis/explainer-venezuelas-unfair-election/)

### 2018 Boycotted Election

- Maduro "won" with 67.8% on 46% turnout (lowest in democratic history)
- OAS declared result illegitimate minutes after inauguration
- Led directly to 2019 Guaido challenge

## Scholarly Debates: Petro-State Collapse

### The Resource Curse Thesis

Venezuela is frequently cited as the paradigmatic case of the "resource curse"---the paradox whereby resource-rich countries often experience worse development outcomes than resource-poor ones.

**Key Arguments:**
- Oil revenues enabled government to ignore economic diversification
- "Dutch Disease": Bolivar appreciation made other sectors uncompetitive
- Weak ties between government and citizens (no dependence on taxation)
- Corruption and rent-seeking concentrated around oil wealth
- [Source: Economics Observatory](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/why-did-venezuelas-economy-collapse)

### Scholarly Works

**Terry Lynn Karl, *The Paradox of Plenty* (1997):**
- Oil wealth induces corruption, rent-seeking, centralized intervention
- Petrostates often develop weak institutions during resource booms
- [Source: Stanford](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/25166042231186352)

**Jonathan Di John, *From Windfall to Curse?* (Penn State Press):**
- Examines Venezuela's oil-development relationship since 1920s
- Questions deterministic "curse" narratives

**Francisco Monaldi, "Political Economy of Oil Contract Renegotiation":**
- In *Beyond the Resource Curse* (U Penn Press, 2012)
- Analyzes how political factors shaped oil policy

### Counter-Arguments

Some scholars caution against determinism:
- Similar conditions have produced different outcomes in Venezuela at different times
- Countries with comparable corruption levels have divergent trajectories
- Agency and policy choices matter---collapse was not inevitable
- "Resource curse" can flatten history into mechanical causation
- [Source: ACE - Downfall of Venezuelan Petrostate](https://ace-usa.org/blog/research/research-foreignpolicy/the-downfall-of-the-venezuelan-petrostate/)

### State Capacity Analysis

Recent scholarship emphasizes:
- Deliberate weakening of technocratic capacity at PDVSA
- Replacement of expertise with political loyalty
- "Unplanned decline" through accumulated policy failures
- Green New Deal implications: cautionary tale for energy transitions

## Comparative Context

### Similar Regimes

- [[cuba-castro]]: Ideological patron and intelligence partner; similarly isolated but more stable
- [[nicaragua-somoza]]: Historical parallel---both regimes dependent on Venezuela for survival
- [[belarus-lukashenko]]: Comparable electoral fraud and post-election crackdowns
- [[russia-putin]]: Key international backer; similar use of courts against opposition

### Distinguishing Features

Venezuela's case is notable for:
1. **Scale of economic collapse**: 80% GDP decline unprecedented outside war
2. **Refugee crisis magnitude**: Largest in Western Hemisphere history

# Philippines Under Rodrigo Duterte (2016-2022)

## Executive Summary

Rodrigo Duterte's presidency (2016-2022) represents a dramatic case of democratic backsliding in Southeast Asia. Rising from his reputation as the tough-talking "Punisher" mayor of Davao City, Duterte won the 2016 election on promises to eliminate crime and corruption "within three to six months." His administration was defined by a brutal "war on drugs" that resulted in an estimated 12,000-30,000 extrajudicial killings, systematic attacks on press freedom, the detention of political opponents, and a controversial pivot toward China. In March 2025, Duterte became the first Asian former head of state arrested and surrendered to the International Criminal Court, where he faces charges of crimes against humanity. His legacy remains contested, with his daughter Sara serving as Vice President until her impeachment proceedings in 2025.

## I. Pre-Conditions: The Crisis That Enabled Duterte's Rise

### A. Post-Marcos Democratic Stagnation

The Philippines' democratic transition following the 1986 "People Power Revolution" against Ferdinand Marcos failed to deliver on promises of reform. [Source: [Carnegie Endowment](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2019/01/philippine-politics-under-duterte-a-midterm-assessment)]

**Structural Problems:**
- Oligarchic structures dominated both political and economic spheres
- Enduring dominance of family clans, including the Marcos family
- Corruption remained endemic across all levels of government
- 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index: 33 out of 100 [Source: [Wikipedia - Corruption in the Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_the_Philippines)]

**The Aquino III Administration (2010-2016):**
- Achieved highest economic growth rates in modern Philippine history
- Anti-corruption drive produced notable prosecutions
- However, growth benefits concentrated among elites: 40 families captured 76% of growth benefits
- 25 million Filipinos continued earning less than $1 per day
- Neoliberal policies exacerbated inequality [Source: [Focus on the Global South](https://focusweb.org/the-marcos-duterte-dynastic-regime-in-the-philippines-how-long-will-it-last/)]

### B. Crime and Drug Concerns

Crime has been a recurring political issue in the Philippines since the 1960s. Marcos used criminality to justify martial law in 1972, and Joseph Estrada's crime-fighting image fueled his 1998 election victory. [Source: [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/duterte-democracy-and-defense/)]

**Crime as Political Issue:**
- High poverty levels contributed to persistent criminal activity
- Underresourced and corruption-prone law enforcement
- Glacially slow judiciary system
- Drug trafficking and illegal gambling as significant features of political economy [Source: [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/duterte-democracy-and-defense/)]

**Anti-Liberal Sentiment:**
- Liberal reformism criticized for failing to establish participatory governance
- Human rights discourse portrayed as contradictory to peace, order, and development
- Growing frustration with elite politics and "yellow" (liberal) forces
- Duterte tapped into desire for "discipline" and stability [Source: [Democratic Erosion](https://democratic-erosion.org/2025/02/14/democratic-backsliding-in-the-philippines/)]

### C. Duterte's Davao Record

Rodrigo Duterte served as mayor of Davao City for over 22 years (seven terms), transforming the "murder capital" into what he claimed was one of the safest cities in the world. [Source: [PBS Frontline](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/bloody-drug-war-rodrigo-duterte-iron-mayor/)]

**The Davao Death Squad:**
- Vigilante group operating under Duterte's mayoralty since the 1990s
- Estimated 1,020-1,424 killings between 1998 and 2015
- Victims included street children, petty criminals, and drug users
- Youngest victim: 12-year-old boy [Source: [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/07/17/rodrigo-duterte-rise-philippines-death-squad-mayor)]

**Duterte's Admissions:**
- In October 2024, Duterte confirmed to the Philippine Senate: "I had a death squad of seven"
- Former police officer Arthur Lascanas (2017) confessed to leading the squad
- Duterte admitted shooting three people while mayor
- 2007: UN Special Rapporteur Philip Alston stated: "A death squad operates in Davao City, with men routinely killing street children and others in broad daylight" [Source: [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/28/philippines-ex-president-duterte-says-he-kept-a-death-squad-as-mayor)]

**DDS Structure (per Senator Leila de Lima):**
- Two distinct periods: 1988-1998 and 2001-2016
- Later transformed into official Heinous Crimes Investigation Section
- Not a loosely connected group but a "highly structured and state-backed death squad" [Source: [Philippine News Agency](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1236090)]

## II. Rise to Power: The 2016 Election

### A. Campaign Strategy

Duterte positioned himself as a political outsider from Mindanao, a region often neglected by Manila-based elites. [Source: [Wikipedia - Rodrigo Duterte 2016 presidential campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte_2016_presidential_campaign)]

**Anti-Establishment Appeal:**
- "One Voice, One Nation" slogan referenced Manila outsider status
- Positioned himself against current political system, not just ruling party
- Called himself "socialist" and opponent of corruption
- Rejected statesman rhetoric for "tabloid language" [Source: [CIRSD](https://www.cirsd.org/en/horizons/horizons-winter-2020-issue-no-15/is-duterte-a-populist-rhetoric-vs-reality)]

**Law-and-Order Rhetoric:**
- Promised to eliminate illegal drugs within "three to six months"
- Campaign urged people to "kill drug addicts"
- Scorched earth approach immediately set him apart
- Voters elected him knowing he would implement illiberal policies [Source: [Journal of Democracy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-vote-in-the-philippines-electing-a-strongman/)]

**Unconventional Style:**
- Flashed middle finger to press without consequence
- Cursed the Pope with no negative impact
- Used Bisaya language to build ethnic appeal among co-ethnics
- Measured political incorrectness enhanced credibility [Source: [ECPS](https://www.populismstudies.org/rodrigo-roa-duterte-a-jingoist-misogynist-penal-populist/)]

- Only post-Marcos president elected with practically no legislative representation
- Strong performance in Mindanao: 60%+ in some areas
- Strong support among millennials (40% of registered voters) [Source: [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/5/10/philippines-election-rodrigo-duterte-claims-victory)]

**Duterte's Public Statements:**
- "My instruction to the officers was, 'encourage the criminals to fight... and when they fight, kill them'"

- Tokhang suspended January 2017 after police abducted South Korean businessman
- PDEA took over as lead agency October 2017

## XI. Scholarly Debates

### A. Penal Populism

Nicole Curato's foundational research (2016) describes Duterte's appeal as "penal populism" built on two reinforcing logics. [Source: [SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/186810341603500305)]

**Key Arguments:**
- *Politics of Anxiety*: Language of crisis, danger, and uncertainty about crime
- *Politics of Hope*: Reclaiming democratic agency through strong leadership
- Belief that "deviant activity" deprives ordinary people of safety
- "Elite-driven" legal system doesn't address common people's concerns [Source: [Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-east-asian-studies/article/new-penal-populism-rodrigo-duterte-public-opinion-and-the-war-on-drugs-in-the-philippines/4AE0C4975F0D73EC0631991A3DE646D6)]

**Paradox:**
- Voters attached to democracy can still favor illiberal policies in law-and-order domains
- Democratic regression may result from voting preferences of pro-democratic voters
- Crime was highly salient issue enabling penal populist appeal [Source: [Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-east-asian-studies/article/new-penal-populism-rodrigo-duterte-public-opinion-and-the-war-on-drugs-in-the-philippines/4AE0C4975F0D73EC0631991A3DE646D6)]

### B. Democratic Backsliding

Scholars debate whether Filipino voters have become illiberal or remain contingent supporters of illiberal policies. [Source: [SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20578911221136263)]

**The "Illiberal Voter" Thesis:**
- Some scholars argued Filipinos acquired "taste for illiberal rule"
- Kasuya and Calimbahin (2024): Survey data does not support this claim
- Filipino voters are "contingent supporters" while maintaining democratic baseline [Source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365931099_Democratic_backsliding_in_the_Philippines_Are_voters_becoming_illiberal)]

**Duterte as Unprecedented:**
- First president elected knowing he would implement illiberal policies
- Maintained high approval despite attacks on democratic institutions
- List experiments suggest popularity may have been inflated by social desirability bias [Source: [Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-east-asian-studies/article/abs/pretending-to-support-dutertes-popularity-and-democratic-backsliding-in-the-philippines/DA8DB740FAF9AD325491853DD5CCDF53)]

### C. Authoritarian Populism

Mark Thompson's research characterizes Duterte's rule as "illiberal democracy" comparable to Orban's Hungary. [Source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334450487_Thompson_Mark_2019_The_Rise_of_Illiberal_Democracy_in_the_Philippines)]

**Key Features:**
- "Right populism" with violent drug war as centerpiece
- Consistent critique of liberal democratic theory and practice
- Human rights portrayed as obstacle to development
- Emphasis on Filipino, Asian, and developing country contexts [Source: [ECPS](https://www.populismstudies.org/the-philippines-from-people-power-to-democratic-backsliding/)]

**Comparative Analysis (Nair, 2023):**
- Duterte compared to Sukarno (Indonesia) and Sihanouk (Cambodia)
- Shared strong distrust of institutions
- Discredited parties, attacked individuals, undercut checks and balances
- All embodied "populism as discursive and stylistic repertoire" [Source: [SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13540661231173866)]

### D. Social Media and Populism

Scholars note Duterte's pioneering use of social media in Southeast Asian politics. [Source: [Intellect](https://intellectdiscover.com/content/journals/10.1386/macp_00097_1)]

**Mechanisms:**
- Social media facilitated populist appeal and legitimacy
- Tool for forming popular beliefs, sentiments, and opinions
- Enabled governance by conspiracy narratives
- Bypassed traditional media gatekeepers [Source: [Yale Review of International Studies](https://yris.yira.org/column/dictatorship-of-the-vengeful-the-rise-of-civic-authoritarianism-in-rodrigo-dutertes-philippines/)]

# Than Shwe's Military Regime in Myanmar (1992-2011)

Senior General Than Shwe ruled Myanmar as chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC, 1992-1997) and its successor, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC, 1997-2011). His nearly two-decade rule was characterized by brutal suppression of democracy movements, ethnic persecution, economic mismanagement, and international isolation, culminating in a carefully managed transition designed to preserve military power.

## Pre-Conditions: The Collapse of Ne Win's Regime

### The Burmese Way to Socialism (1962-1988)

General [[myanmar-ne-win|Ne Win]] seized power in a 1962 coup and implemented the "Burmese Way to Socialism," a program of economic isolation and military strengthening that transformed Myanmar into one of the world's most impoverished countries. [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Than-Shwe)

### The 8888 Uprising

On August 8, 1988 ("8-8-88"), a general strike and mass demonstrations erupted across Myanmar, organized largely by university students demanding democratic reform. The protests became known as the **8888 Uprising**.

Key events:
- **July 23, 1988**: Ne Win resigned as head of the Burma Socialist Programme Party, warning demonstrators that "if the army shoots, it hits; it does not aim into the air" [NPR Timeline](https://www.npr.org/2013/08/08/210233784/timeline-myanmars-8-8-88-uprising)
- **August 8, 1988**: Mass demonstrations held simultaneously across the country
- **August 10, 1988**: Soldiers deliberately fired on doctors and nurses at Rangoon General Hospital
- **August 26, 1988**: Aung San Suu Kyi addressed approximately one million people at Shwedagon Pagoda [Wikipedia: 8888 Uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8888_Uprising)

**Death toll**: Approximately 3,000 killed according to Amnesty International (1990), US Congress (1990), and scholar David Steinberg (2001). Estimates range from 3,000 to 10,000 deaths. [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/mass-violence-war-massacre-resistance/en/document/repression-august-8-12-1988-8-8-88-uprising-burmamyanmar.html)

### Formation of SLORC (September 18, 1988)

General Saw Maung led a coup on September 18, 1988, establishing the **State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC)**:

- Repealed the 1974 constitution
- Imposed martial law
- Promised political reform and elections
- Violently suppressed ongoing protests, killing an estimated additional 3,000 people
- Over 10,000 activists fled to border regions [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/06/burma-justice-1988-massacres)

SLORC's founding members included Lt-Gen. Than Shwe and Brigadier General Khin Nyunt. [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2013/08/08/210233784/timeline-myanmars-8-8-88-uprising)

## Rise to Power: Than Shwe's Ascent (1992)

### Military Career Background

- **Born**: February 2, 1933, in Kyaukse, Burma
- **Early career**: Postal clerk before joining the army in 1953
- **Specialization**: Psychological warfare and counterinsurgency against Karen insurgents
- **Promotions**: Captain (1960), Colonel (1978), Commander of 88th Light Infantry Division (1980), Brigadier General (1984)
- **Post-1988**: Vice-Chairman of SLORC and Vice Commander-in-Chief [Wikipedia: Than Shwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Than_Shwe)

### The 1992 Transition

On April 23, 1992, Senior General Saw Maung unexpectedly resigned, citing health reasons (including reports of mental deterioration). Than Shwe:

- Elevated himself to Senior General
- Replaced Saw Maung as SLORC Chairman
- Became Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces
- Had survived previous internal purges within the junta [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Than-Shwe)

### Consolidation: SLORC to SPDC (1997)

In 1997, Than Shwe renamed SLORC the **State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)**, reducing membership from 21 to 19 while retaining key figures. [Wikipedia: State Peace and Development Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Peace_and_Development_Council)

## The 1990 Election Denial

### Election Results

On May 27, 1990, Myanmar held its first multiparty elections in 30 years:

- **NLD Victory**: 392 of 492 contested seats (81%)
- **National Unity Party (military-backed)**: 10 seats despite 21% vote share
- **Voter turnout**: 73%
- **Note**: Aung San Suu Kyi had been placed under house arrest on July 20, 1989, before the election [Wikipedia: 1990 Myanmar general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Myanmar_general_election)

### Military Refusal

SLORC initially indicated it would honor results, then:

- Claimed the vote was only to form a constitution-drafting assembly, not a parliament
- Issued **Order 1/90** asserting legitimacy to rule based on international recognition
- Disqualified, detained, or imprisoned many elected candidates
- Many representatives fled; some established the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma (NCGUB) in exile [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/05/26/burma-20-years-after-1990-elections-democracy-still-denied)

---

## Methods of Control

### The Tatmadaw as "State Within a State"

The Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) operated as a parallel state structure:

> "The systematic violation of human rights by intelligence agencies stemmed from factors including the military regime's intense nationalism, its pervasive sense of vulnerability to both internal and external threats, the conviction that only a strong central government dominated by the Tatmadaw could protect and preserve the Union, and the impunity it enjoyed in the exercise of power against the civil population." [Stimson Center](https://www.stimson.org/2021/myanmar-an-enduring-intelligence-state/)

### Intelligence Apparatus

**General Khin Nyunt** served as the ruthless head of Military Intelligence (MI) for over 20 years:

- MI and Special Branch monitored the civilian population
- Extensive network of spies and informers
- Surveillance technology for electronic monitoring
- Dossiers compiled on senior leaders as political insurance [Lowy Institute](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/myanmar-s-intelligence-apparatus-under-aung-san-suu-kyi)

### The 2004 Purge of Khin Nyunt

On October 18, 2004, Than Shwe dismissed and arrested Prime Minister Khin Nyunt:

- Over 3,000 intelligence officers detained
- Entire intelligence network dismantled
- Official charges: corruption, disobeying orders, exceeding authority
- Khin Nyunt sentenced to 44 years (served under house arrest, pardoned 2012) [The Irrawaddy](https://www.irrawaddy.com/specials/on-this-day/day-myanmars-military-intelligence-chief-sacked.html)

### Divide-and-Rule Ethnic Policy

The Tatmadaw employed systematic divide-and-rule tactics against ethnic armed organizations:

> "While it struck ceasefire deals with some, it concentrated its firepower on others. These ceasefire accords have mostly been accompanied by lucrative business concessions, which had another divide-and-rule effect. It sparked factionalizing within armed groups, with some leaders getting rich and corrupt while others held on to their revolutionary principles." [The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2014/03/the-tatmadaws-divide-and-rule-tactics-in-myanmar/)

**Khin Nyunt's ceasefire characteristics** (1990s):
1. No international third parties in negotiations
2. No political settlement discussions permitted
3. Groups could retain arms
4. Territories demarcated
5. Leaders allowed to engage in legal and illicit business
6. Most deals were solely oral (except KIO's 1994 written agreement) [Transnational Institute](https://www.tni.org/files/download/ceasefire.pdf)

By century's end, 20 armed opposition groups had ceasefire agreements, but the government held no political discussions with these groups.

## Aung San Suu Kyi and Political Opposition

### Detention Periods

Aung San Suu Kyi was held under house arrest for nearly 15 of the 21 years between 1989 and 2010:

| Period | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| 1989-1995 | 6 years |
| 2000-2002 | ~2 years |
| 2003-2010 | ~7 years |

[Wikipedia: Aung San Suu Kyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi)

### Nobel Peace Prize (1991)

- Awarded "for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights"
- Her sons Alexander and Kim Aris accepted on her behalf
- She used the $1.3 million prize to establish a health and education trust for the Burmese people
- Finally delivered her Nobel lecture in Oslo in 2012 [Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1991/kyi/facts/)

### Than Shwe's Personal Animosity

Than Shwe was described as "the isolationist counter-force to moderates" who broke off UN-supported dialogue with the opposition in 2003 and harbored "a personal grudge toward Aung San Suu Kyi." [Facts and Details](https://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Myanmar/sub5_5b/entry-3012.html)

---

## Ethnic Conflicts

### Karen Conflict

The Karen National Union (KNU) has fought for an independent Kawthoolei state since 1949:

- **Under Than Shwe**: Counterinsurgency intensified after 1992
- **2006 Offensive**: Major military campaign against KNU's armed wing (KNLA)
- **Displacement**: Approximately 500,000 people displaced; 30,000 in local areas since 1990s "regional clearance" operations
- **Human rights abuses**: Burning villages, laying landmines, arbitrary arrests, executions, rape, torture, forced labor, use of civilians as porters [Wikipedia: Karen conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_conflict)

### Kachin Conflict

The Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) and its armed wing, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA):

- **1994 Ceasefire**: Signed on February 24, 1994, after military offensive seized jade mines
- **Duration**: Lasted 17 years (1994-2011)
- **Terms**: KIO ceded control of Hpakant jade mining area; turned to timber exploitation
- **Breakdown**: In 2010, SPDC demanded all ethnic armed organizations transform into border guard forces; KIO refused; ceasefire broken in June 2011 [Wikipedia: Kachin conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachin_conflict)

### Shan State and the Drug Trade

- **1990s**: Shan State was center of the "Golden Triangle" heroin production
- **Khun Sa**: "Opium King" commanded 20,000-strong Mong Tai Army until 1996 surrender
- **Post-1996**: Shan State Army-South formed by commanders who refused to surrender
- **Drug economy**: Integral to informal brokerage between military-state and local strongmen; Tatmadaw collected taxes directly from poppy farmers [International Crisis Group](https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-east-asia/myanmar/299-fire-and-ice-conflict-and-drugs-myanmars-shan-state)

### Rohingya Persecution

Early persecution foundations laid under Than Shwe's regime:

- **1982 Citizenship Act**: Denied Rohingya citizenship, classifying them as illegal immigrants
- **1992 Government Statement**: "There has never been a 'Rohingya' race in Myanmar"
- **NaSaKa Border Force**: Created in 1992 under SPDC command to control Rohingya movement
- **1990s Exodus**: More than 250,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh
- **Restrictions**: Denial of higher education, public office, freedom of movement
- **Land confiscation**: Widespread since 1990s; "model villages" reserved exclusively for Buddhists [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/burma/burm005-02.htm)

---

## Economic Mismanagement

### Policies Under Than Shwe

- Advocated some deregulation but policies criticized as "ill-planned"
- Promoted crony capitalism
- **2009 Rating**: Economy ranked least free in Asia (tied with North Korea)
- **2007 Corruption**: Myanmar tied with Somalia as world's most corrupt country (Transparency International) [Wikipedia: Corruption in Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Myanmar)

### Natural Resource Exploitation

Despite abundant natural resources, Myanmar remained among Asia's poorest nations:

- **Jade Trade (2014)**: Worth up to $31 billion (~half of GDP)
- **Government Revenue**: Only ~1% of jade value captured as taxes/royalties
- **Beneficiaries**: Than Shwe, military cronies, and drug lords identified by Global Witness [EIA Reports](https://reports.eia-international.org/stateofcorruption/)
- **Timber**: Entire forestry sector "riddled with corruption" going to "the very top" of military administration [Heinrich Boll Foundation](https://eu.boell.org/en/2016/04/01/burmas-rocky-path-democracy-role-natural-resources)

### Impact of Western Sanctions

Sanctions imposed in late 1980s-1990s:

- **Effect on Population**: "Devastated civil society and small businesses while leaving the generals largely untouched"
- **Evasion**: Asian nations, especially China, expanded trade with Myanmar
- **Garment Industry**: Lost $200 million in exports after 2003 US sanctions; 150 factory closures; 80,000 unemployed
- **Assessment**: "Sanctions did not generate Myanmar's transition from military rule in 2011" [Lawfare](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/sanctions-relief-for-myanmar--a-case-study)

---

## The 2007 Saffron Revolution

### Trigger

In August 2007, the government removed fuel subsidies:
- Diesel and petrol prices increased 66-100%
- Compressed natural gas for buses increased 500% in less than a week [Wikipedia: Saffron Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron_Revolution)

### Monk-Led Protests

- **September 5**: Buddhist monks marched in Pakokku; some beaten
- **September 17**: Sangha demanded government apology; deadline passed without response
- **September 24**: Up to 100,000 marched in Rangoon - largest protests since 1988 [RFA](https://www.rfa.org/english/special-reports/saffron/)

### Violent Crackdown

- **September 25**: Curfew imposed (9pm-5am); gatherings over 5 people banned
- **September 27**: Troops opened fire on demonstrators; raided monasteries
- **Deployment**: ~20,000 troops in Rangoon
- **Arrests**: Over 6,000 detained, including ~1,400 monks [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/report/2007/12/06/crackdown/repression-2007-popular-protests-burma)

### Casualties

## Cyclone Nargis (2008)

### The Disaster

On May 2, 2008, Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar:
- Storm surge reached 40 kilometers up the Irrawaddy delta
- **Official death toll**: 138,373 (likely underreported)
- **Labutta Township alone**: 80,000 dead
- **Missing**: ~55,000 people
- Worst natural disaster in Myanmar's recorded history [Wikipedia: Cyclone Nargis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Nargis)

### Blocking of International Aid

The junta's response was widely condemned:

- **Than Shwe's position**: Myanmar was "capable of handling the relief effort" but would allow limited assistance with "no strings attached"
- **UN Attempts**: Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon tried repeatedly to reach Than Shwe by phone for days without success
- **Aid delays**: After one week, only 10% of those in need received aid; after two weeks, only 25%
- **Visa refusals**: International aid workers denied entry for weeks
- **USS Essex**: American carrier group left after being denied entry for weeks, taking undelivered aid
- **Arrests**: Local volunteers arrested; regime used disaster to push through constitutional referendum [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/remembering-myanmars-miserable-may)

### Than Shwe's Priorities

> "In the hours after Tropical Cyclone Nargis ravaged Myanmar, U.N. officials tried to call the country's top leader to offer help. For several days, they got no answer... Finally, the real reason became clear: Than Shwe didn't really want their help. A week after the cyclone swept the Irrawaddy River delta, Than Shwe made his first appearance - not to comfort the victims, but to vote on a referendum enshrining the government's power." [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/05/03/lessons-cyclone-nargis)

The constitutional referendum proceeded on May 10, 2008, just eight days after the cyclone.

## The 2010 Managed Transition

### The 2008 Constitution

Drafted by the military and approved in a May 2008 referendum (officially 93.82% approval) held days after Cyclone Nargis:

**Key provisions preserving military power**:
- 25% of parliamentary seats reserved for serving military officers
- Ministries of Defense, Home Affairs, and Border Affairs must be headed by military officers
- Military appoints one of two Vice Presidents
- Constitutional amendments require >75% parliamentary approval (giving military effective veto)
- Article 445: Blanket immunity for government actions
[Wikipedia: 2008 Constitution of Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Constitution_of_Myanmar)

### 2010 Elections

On November 7, 2010, Myanmar held elections under the new constitution:

- NLD boycotted, citing unfair conditions
- Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) - military-backed - won majority
- Widely criticized as neither free nor fair
- Aung San Suu Kyi released from house arrest six days after election (November 13, 2010) [Carnegie Endowment](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2015/06/myanmars-military-keeps-firm-grip-on-democratic-transition?lang=en)

### Than Shwe's Retirement

In March 2011:
- Than Shwe formally disbanded the SPDC
- Relinquished position as head of state/government
- Stepped down from military
- Former general Thein Sein became first president under new constitution
- Than Shwe placed loyalists in key positions throughout government [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/10/myanmar-democracys-dead-end)

> "The reform period was never intended to end military domination. It was rather a masterpiece of former dictator Than Shwe's retirement plan." [Carnegie Endowment](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2021/02/end-of-myanmars-rocky-road-to-democracy?lang=en)

## Scholarly Debates

### Myanmar as a Praetorian State

Scholars describe Myanmar's system as **praetorian** - where "military officers are the major political actors by virtue of their actual or threatened use of force":

> "Two inextricably linked challenges characterize politics and society in Myanmar since independence in 1948: state-building and nation-building in a post-colonial plural society, and the persistence of a praetorian state in which the Burmese Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) dominates politics, the economy, and society." [Taylor & Francis](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9780429322013-2/myanmar-trial-error-praetorian-regime-roger-lee-huang)

### The "Dictated" vs. "Pacted" Transition Debate

Myanmar challenges standard democratic transition theory:

> "The 'breakdown' of military governments is usually attributed to intra-military factionalism, which prompts 'soft-liners' to seek pacts with a rising societal opposition. However, these factors were absent in Myanmar. Experts consistently observe that the Tatmadaw's impressive coherence only increased over time. Rather than regime instability forcing 'pacts' with opposition forces, the transition was clearly 'dictated' from a position of strength - a scenario the 'transitions' literature generally neglects." [E-International Relations](https://www.e-ir.info/2010/05/06/the-persistence-of-military-domination-in-myanmar/)

### Managed Transition vs. Genuine Reform

The 2011 transition is debated between two interpretations:

1. **Managed Transition View**: The military designed electoral authoritarianism to safeguard its interests while creating a civilian facade
2. **Strategic Opening View**: Generals sought to reduce over-dependence on China by reaching out to Western countries

> "The liberalisation since 2011 was consequently more imposed than pacted and reflected the military's changing (security) interests. Since the 1990s, the military has become the dominant actor both in politics and the economy with its own business conglomerates and crony companies." [Stimson Center](https://www.stimson.org/2021/transforming-civil-military-relations-myanmar-in-comparative-perspective/)

### Ceasefire Capitalism

Scholars have analyzed the economic dimensions of ethnic ceasefires:

> "The signed ceasefire agreements have been nothing more than temporary military truces to suspend fighting and preserve the status quo... This has been described as a 'neither war nor peace' policy." [Transnational Institute](https://www.tni.org/en/publication/the-nationwide-ceasefire-agreement-in-myanmar)

### Legacy and the 2021 Coup

The failure of Myanmar's transition culminated in the February 1, 2021 coup by [[myanmar-min-aung-hlaing|Min Aung Hlaing]], demonstrating the limits of managed democratization:

> "A particular focus is on the failure of the military-initiated process of gradual disengagement from day-to-day politics from 2011 to 2021." [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363182553_Myanmar_Political_Conflict_and_the_Survival_of_the_Praetorian_State)

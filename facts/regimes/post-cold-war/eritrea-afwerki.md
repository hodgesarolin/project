# Eritrea Under Isaias Afwerki (1993-Present)

> "Let's wait 3 or 4 decades" - Isaias Afwerki, when asked in 2010 when elections would be held [^1]

## Overview

Eritrea under President Isaias Afwerki represents one of the world's most closed and repressive societies, frequently called "Africa's North Korea." Since independence in 1993, Afwerki has ruled without elections, without implementing the ratified 1997 constitution, without independent media, and with a system of indefinite conscription that the United Nations has characterized as involving "slavery-like practices." [^2] [^3]

The regime emerged from a 30-year liberation struggle that was widely celebrated, but transformed after 2001 into a totalitarian state following an internal reform challenge. Eritrea consistently ranks last or near-last in global press freedom and political rights indices.

---

## 1. Pre-Conditions: The Road to Independence

### Italian Colonialism and British Administration

Eritrea was an Italian colony from the 1880s until Italy's defeat by the Allies in World War II in 1941. It then became a British protectorate until 1951. [^4]

### Federation with Ethiopia (1952-1962)

The United Nations voted in favor of a federation between Eritrea and Ethiopia, which was established in 1952. This was intended as a transitional arrangement preparing Eritreans for a 1962 referendum on full union versus independence. [^5]

From the start, Emperor Haile Selassie systematically undermined Eritrean autonomy:
- Imposed preventive detention laws allowing suppression of political movements
- Forced elected community leaders to resign
- Replaced the Eritrean flag with Ethiopia's
- Imposed Amharic in public services and schools
- Lobbied and coerced Eritrean assembly members

> "Eritrea's autonomy was curtailed and the region was effectively governed as a police state by imperial authorities during the 1950s." [^5]

### The 1962 Annexation

On November 14, 1962, Ethiopian troops forced the Eritrean Parliament to dissolve, and Eritrea was annexed as Ethiopia's fourteenth province in violation of UN Resolution 390(A). [^5] [^6]

### The 30-Year Independence War (1961-1991)

The Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) launched the armed struggle in September 1961 under Hamid Idris Awate. This became the longest military independence struggle in modern African history. [^4]

**Formation of the EPLF**

In 1970, members broke from the ELF to form what would become the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) in 1973. Isaias Afwerki, who had abandoned engineering studies in Addis Ababa in 1966 to join the independence movement and received military training in China in 1967, became deputy secretary-general in 1977 and effective leader (secretary-general) in 1987. [^1]

**Human Cost of the War**
- 60,000-80,000 Eritreans killed
- Similar numbers permanently disabled
- ~50,000 children orphaned
- ~500,000 refugees (from a population of 3 million) [^4]

**Victory**

The EPLF transformed into a conventional army, famously defending the town of Nakfa against continuous Ethiopian air attacks. In February 1990, Operation Fenkil captured Massawa. On May 24, 1991, EPLF forces achieved victory, ending the war. [^4]

---

## 2. Rise to Power: Independence and the Constitution That Never Was

### The 1993 Independence Referendum

The EPLF established itself as the Provisional Government of Eritrea (PGE) in 1991. A UN-supervised referendum was held April 23-25, 1993, with 99.8% voting for independence on a turnout exceeding 93%. Independence was formally declared on May 24, 1993. [^7] [^8]

The PGE promised a four-year transition to:
- Draft and ratify a constitution
- Draft a law on political parties
- Draft a press law
- Hold elections for a constitutional government [^9]

### The 1997 Constitution

A three-year drafting process produced a constitution ratified by a 421-member Constituent Assembly on May 23, 1997. It provided for:
- Popular sovereignty
- Separation of powers
- Multi-party democracy
- Directly elected president
- Bicameral legislature [^10] [^11]

**The Constitution Was Never Implemented**

Despite ratification, President Afwerki never proclaimed or implemented the constitution, citing national unity and stability. The 1998-2000 border war with Ethiopia provided the primary justification for indefinitely deferring elections and constitutional provisions. [^10]

In 2014, Isaias declared: "The 1997 constitution is dead, and we will draft a new constitution." No new constitution has been produced. [^10]

---

## 3. Methods of Control

### One-Party Rule

The EPLF reconstituted itself as the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) in 1994. It remains the sole legal political party. The PFDJ has not held a party convention since January 2002. [^12] [^13]

### No Elections

Eritrea has never held a national election since the 1993 independence referendum. Parliamentary elections scheduled for 2001 were indefinitely postponed. The transitional National Assembly has not met since 2002. [^12]

> "Eritrea is a highly centralized, totalitarian regime under the control of President Isaias Afwerki. A constitution drafted in 1997 was never implemented. The People's Front for Democracy and Justice, headed by the president, is the sole political party. There have been no national-level elections since an independence referendum in 1993." - Freedom House 2024 [^12]

### No Independent Media

On September 18-19, 2001, the government withdrew licenses from all eight independent newspapers and arrested journalists. Since then, there has been no independent national media in Eritrea. [^14] [^15]

The only media operating is government-controlled under the Ministry of Information - a news agency, publications, and Eri TV - all subject to strict oversight and required to relay regime propaganda. [^15]

**Press Freedom Rankings**
- Reporters Without Borders: 180th out of 180 countries (last place for 8 of past 9 years) [^15]
- Only North Korea and Turkmenistan rank similarly [^16]

**Imprisoned Journalists**
- 16 journalists remain imprisoned as of late 2023, none ever charged [^14]
- Many held longer than any other journalists in the world
- Dawit Isaak (Swedish-Eritrean) arrested in 2001, still detained
- President Afwerki said in 2009: "We won't release him and he won't have a trial" [^15]

### No Civil Society

All NGOs have been expelled, foreign news agencies denied access. There are no independent civic organizations, human rights groups, or opposition voices permitted within the country. [^17]

---

## 4. Indefinite Conscription: "Making Us Into Slaves"

### Legal Framework vs. Reality

The National Service Proclamation of 1995 established mandatory 18-month service for all Eritreans aged 18-40. However, in 2002, the government removed this limit and extended service indefinitely. [^18] [^19]

**Reality:**
- Many conscripts serve for decades
- Some interviewed had served 10-20+ years before fleeing [^19]
- Wages insufficient to support a family
- No indication of when release will occur [^18]

### UN Findings: "Slavery-Like Practices"

The UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea found that "slavery-like practices are routine" within the national service system, citing:
- Indefinite duration
- Terrible conditions
- Arbitrary detention and torture
- Sexual torture
- Forced labor
- Absence of leave
- Ludicrous pay [^20]

### Education as Conscription Pipeline

Since 2003, all secondary school students must complete their final 12th grade year at Sawa military camp. Students are under military command throughout their final year, subject to harsh punishments, military discipline, and forced labor. Many are conscripted directly from school into national service. [^18] [^21]

### Enforcement Mechanisms

The system is maintained through:
- Summary executions
- Brutal punishments
- Reprisals against families of deserters
- Extensive prison infrastructure outside rule of law
- Torture and cruel treatment with impunity [^22]

In 2023, Human Rights Watch documented a crackdown on families of draft evaders, with relatives detained or fined for their children's escape. [^23]

---

## 5. The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea War

### Background

After initial friendly relations following Eritrean independence, border disagreements deteriorated into full-scale war beginning May 6, 1998, when Eritrean forces entered the disputed Badme region. [^24] [^25]

### Scale of the Conflict

- Largest war in the world at the time
- Over 500,000 troops deployed on both sides
- Ethiopia: ~250,000 troops mobilized
- Eritrea: ~250,000 troops mobilized [^24]

### Casualties

Estimates vary widely:
- Combined deaths: 70,000-300,000
- 600,000 people displaced [^24] [^25]

### Key Events

- **February 1999:** Ethiopia launches major offensive, recaptures Badme
- **May 2000:** Ethiopia breaks through Eritrean lines, advances deep into Eritrean territory
- **June 18, 2000:** Ceasefire signed
- **December 12, 2000:** Algiers Agreement formally ends war [^24]

### Border Resolution and Peace

- 2005: Boundary Commission rules Badme belongs to Eritrea
- 2018: Ethiopia under PM Abiy Ahmed agrees to implement peace treaty
- July 2018: Peace declared by both parties
- 2019: Abiy Ahmed receives Nobel Peace Prize [^24]

### War as Justification for Repression

The border stalemate served as pretext for 18 years to:
- Suspend the constitution
- Limit all rights and freedoms
- Extend national service indefinitely
- Postpone elections indeterminately
- Imprison citizens without due process [^26]

> When the border conflict was resolved in 2018, these policies did not change. [^27]

---

## 6. The G-15 Crackdown (2001): The Turning Point

### The Open Letter

In May 2001, fifteen senior PFDJ officials issued an open letter criticizing President Afwerki's "illegal and unconstitutional" governance. They demanded:
- Implementation of the 1997 Constitution
- Restoration of democratic practices within the PFDJ
- Greater accountability in government [^28] [^29]

### The Arrests

On September 18-19, 2001 - while global attention focused on the September 11 attacks - the government arrested 11 of the G-15 members, including:
- Petros Solomon (former Foreign Minister)
- Mahmoud Ahmed Sherifo (former Vice President)
- Haile Woldensae (former Foreign Minister)
- Several other high-ranking former officials [^28] [^29]

The three who escaped arrest were abroad:
- Haile Menkurios (former UN Ambassador)
- Adhanom Gebremariam (former Ambassador to Nigeria)
- Mesfin Hagos (former Defence Minister) [^28]

### Never Seen Again

- None have been charged with any offense
- None have been seen since arrest
- All held incommunicado without trial [^28]

**Reports of Deaths:**
In 2010, a former prison guard claimed six of the eleven had died:
- Ogbe Abraha: died 2002 (asthma)
- Mahmoud Ahmed Sherifo: died 2003 (neck infection)
- Four others: died from "illness and heat exhaustion"
- Haile Woldetensae reportedly lost his sight [^29]

### Simultaneous Media Crackdown

The same days as the G-15 arrests, the government:
- Withdrew licenses of all 8 independent newspapers
- Arrested 10 journalists
- Effectively ended press freedom in Eritrea [^14] [^28]

### Legal Findings

In 2003, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights found the arrests violated multiple articles of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. The Eritrean government has not complied. [^29]

---

## 7. Religious Persecution

### Recognized Religions

The government recognizes only four religious groups (since 2002):
- Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church
- Sunni Islam
- Catholic Church
- Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea [^30]

No additional religious groups have been approved for registration since 2002. Eritrea has been designated a "Country of Particular Concern" by the U.S. under the International Religious Freedom Act since 2004. [^30]

### Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses

On October 25, 1994, President Afwerki revoked the citizenship of all Jehovah's Witnesses for refusing military service. Since then:
- Over 270 imprisoned over 30 years
- 64 currently imprisoned (2024), none charged with any crime
- Denied citizenship, travel documents, government jobs, business licenses [^31]

### Persecution of Christians

- Estimated 500-1,000 Christians detained for faith [^30]
- Pastors Haile Nayzgi and Dr. Kiflu Gebremeskel arrested in 2004, still held (20+ years)
- Bishop Abune Antonios died at 94 in 2022 while under house arrest
- Pastor Tesfay Seyoum died of brain hemorrhage in Mai Serwa Prison after 10 years detention [^30]

### Persecution of Muslims

In 2017, 300 Sunni students of Diya'e Islamic School were arrested after protesting government regulation of their school. Released in 2023 after years of detention. [^30]

---

## 8. "Africa's North Korea": Information Control and Isolation

### The Comparison

Eritrea is frequently called "the North Korea of Africa" for its:
- Total information blackout
- Extreme isolation
- Totalitarian control
- Lack of press freedom [^16] [^32]

An ex-Eritrean diplomat who fled said the comparison doesn't do justice to Eritrea - calling Asmara "a less open place than Pyongyang." [^16]

### Internet and Communication Control

- No mobile data in the country
- Citizens cannot have internet at home or offices
- Extremely slow WiFi only at controlled locations
- Many websites blocked (VPN required)
- Radio waves of exile broadcasts often jammed [^16] [^33]

### Movement Restrictions

- Permits required for foreigners to travel outside Asmara
- Many areas completely off-limits
- Land borders are closed; flying is the only legal entry/exit
- Leaving the country without permission is illegal (punishable by imprisonment) [^16]

### Only Independent Voice

Radio Erena, founded in Paris in 2009 by exiled journalists, attempts to breach the information blackout. It has a network of sources inside Eritrea and broadcasts during lunch hours when people can listen privately. [^33]

### Absence of Personality Cult

Notably, unlike many authoritarian states, Isaias Afwerki has largely avoided a cult of personality:
- His portrait is not on banknotes
- Rarely seen outside official buildings
- No North Korean-style statues
- Family keeps low profile [^34]

He reportedly learned "all the wrong things" during political commissar training in China 1966-67, including being "turned off by the cult of personality surrounding Mao" - while internalizing Maoist ideology. [^34]

---

## 9. Refugee Crisis and Mass Exodus

### Scale of the Crisis

As of 2024:
- 683,000+ registered Eritrean refugees and asylum seekers globally [^35] [^36]
- Approximately 11-18% of total population has fled [^36]
- Eritrea is the 10th largest source country for refugees globally [^37]
- Most live in East Africa: Ethiopia (~180,000), Sudan (~126,000) [^35]

### Mediterranean Crossing

- Eritreans constitute the second-largest group of refugees reaching Europe [^35]
- ~40,000 Eritrean sea arrivals to Italy in 2014 and 2015 [^35]
- Thousands have died attempting Mediterranean crossing [^35]

### Root Causes

Primary drivers of exodus:
1. Indefinite national service/conscription
2. Arbitrary detention and torture
3. Religious persecution
4. No political freedom or rule of law
5. Economic desperation [^35] [^36]

> "Thousands of Eritreans have fled a repressive dictatorship since 2001, making their small nation one of the largest per capita producers of asylum seekers in the world." [^35]

### Forced Returns

Between December 2024 and February 2025, more than 600 Eritrean refugees were forcibly repatriated from Ethiopia. [^37]

---

## 10. Tigray War Involvement (2020-2022)

### Alliance with Ethiopia

The 2018 peace agreement between Eritrea and Ethiopia under PM Abiy Ahmed paved the way for military cooperation. When war erupted in Ethiopia's Tigray region on November 4, 2020, Eritrean forces intervened on Ethiopia's side against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). [^38] [^39]

### Denial and Admission

For months, both Ethiopia and Eritrea denied Eritrean troop presence in Tigray. In March 2021, PM Abiy finally admitted Eritrean forces were fighting there. [^38]

### Documented Atrocities

**The Axum Massacre (November 28-29, 2020)**
Eritrean Defence Forces massacred an estimated 720-800 civilians in the historic town of Axum, including children as young as 13. [^40] [^41]

> "Ethiopian and Eritrean troops carried out multiple war crimes in their offensive to take control of Axum. Above and beyond that, Eritrean troops went on a rampage and systematically killed hundreds of civilians in cold blood, which appears to constitute crimes against humanity." - Amnesty International [^41]

**Sexual Violence**
- 1 in 10 women in Tigray subjected to sexual violence during conflict [^42]
- Rape used systematically as weapon of war
- Girls as young as 8, women as old as 72 raped
- Sexual violence accompanied by burning, insertion of objects
- Stated aim: "cleansing Tigrayan blood" [^42]

**War Crimes Findings**
September 2022 UN investigators found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces, including:
- Extrajudicial executions
- Sexual slavery
- Starvation as a weapon of war [^43]

### U.S. Sanctions

**August 2021:** Treasury Department sanctioned Filipos Woldeyohannes, Chief of Staff of Eritrean Defense Forces, under Global Magnitsky Act for:
- Massacres
- Widespread sexual assault
- Execution of boys
- Forced eviction of Tigrayans [^44]

**November 2021:** Expanded sanctions on:
- Eritrean Defense Forces
- People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ)
- Hidri Trust (PFDJ holding company)
- Red Sea Trading Corporation
- Senior Eritrean officials [^45]

### Continued Presence After Ceasefire

Despite the November 2022 Tigray ceasefire (Pretoria Agreement), which notably did not mention Eritrea:
- Eritrean forces remained in Tigray throughout 2024
- Continued sexual violence, disappearances, looting reported [^37] [^43]

### Death Toll

Officials believe the Tigray war claimed approximately 600,000 civilian lives. [^38]

---

## 11. Current Status (2024-2025)

### Political Situation

- No elections ever held since 1993
- Constitution remains unimplemented
- National Assembly has not met since 2002
- Country governed by presidential decree [^12] [^37]

> "Eritrea is a militarized authoritarian state... The authorities' intolerance of dissent and the absence of elections or opposition parties leave individuals with no political options other than loyalty to the PFDJ, imprisonment, or illegal emigration." - Freedom House [^12]

### Human Rights

2024-2025 UN assessments document:
- Arbitrary and incommunicado detention
- Enforced disappearances
- Indefinite national service amounting to forced labor
- Torture
- Systemic repression of fundamental freedoms [^37]

In December 2025, authorities released 13 long-term detainees after nearly 18 years - representing only a handful among an estimated 10,000+ held without charge. [^46]

### Economic Situation

- Command economy controlled by PFDJ and military
- All significant enterprises state-owned
- GDP growth ~2.9% (2023)
- Debt-to-GDP ratio: 211% (one of highest globally)
- Widespread poverty, though data limited
- Agriculture-dependent, food insecurity endemic [^47] [^48]

### Succession Question

Isaias Afwerki (born February 2, 1946) will turn 80 in 2026. There is no visible succession plan:
- No functioning constitution
- No independent judiciary
- No elected legislature
- Cabinet has not convened since 2018 [^49]

His son Abraham Isaias Afwerki was appointed special advisor for strategic studies in 2018 and has taken increasingly public roles, suggesting possible dynastic succession. [^49]

> "When the inevitable transition comes, it will not be managed by strong institutions, but by individuals and factions scrambling to fill the void." [^49]

### Regional Position

- Rejoined IGAD (regional body) June 2023, never participated meaningfully
- Formally withdrew again December 2025
- Remains internationally isolated [^50]

---

## 12. Scholarly Debates

### Totalitarianism in Africa

Scholars identify three contemporary African countries as totalitarian: Eritrea, Ethiopia (under EPRDF/before 2018), and Rwanda. Three others show strong totalitarian tendencies: Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. [^51]

Key scholarly works on Eritrea as totalitarian:
- Kjetil Tronvoll: *The Lasting Struggle for Freedom in Eritrea: Human Rights and Political Development, 1991-2009*
- Kidane Mengisteab and Yohannes Okbazghi: *Anatomy of an African Tragedy: Political, Economic and Foreign Policy Crisis in Post-Independence Eritrea*
- Martin Plaut: *Understanding Eritrea: Inside Africa's Most Repressive State* [^51] [^52]

**Theoretical Framework**

Tronvoll (2015) characterizes Eritrea's approach as a "doctrine of totalitarianism" where external conflict is deliberately cultivated as a tool of regime survival. [^26]

**Transformation Trajectory**

In the early 1990s, Eritrea was praised as a model for post-conflict governance. Following the 1998-2000 border war, it degenerated from "the one ray of hope in the Horn of Africa" into a totalitarian state. [^51]

### Conscription as Social Control

Academic research on Eritrea's national service system emphasizes its function beyond military defense:

**Control Mechanisms:**
- Deprivation of individual liberty and autonomy
- Creation of "false consciousness" that persists even after fleeing [^53]
- Massive national-scope repressive apparatus required to enforce
- Fear-based compliance through brutal punishment [^22]

**Stated vs. Actual Purpose:**

Researcher Kibreab (2017) notes the stated aims were:
1. Creating strong defense force
2. Regenerating and transmitting national values
3. Vehicle for national unity [^27]

In practice, the system serves to:
- Control the population
- Prevent independent economic activity
- Eliminate alternatives to state employment
- Make emigration the only escape, draining potential opposition [^21] [^53]

> "The control exercised over conscripts deprives them of their individual liberty and autonomy, leaving many in a state of 'false consciousness', even years after having left Eritrea." [^53]

## Patterns and Comparisons

### Similarities to [[north-korea-kim-dynasty]]

- Information blackout and isolation
- Mandatory military/national service
- No independent media
- Last/near-last in press freedom
- Citizens cannot freely leave
- Command economy
- International sanctions

**Key Difference:** Eritrea lacks North Korea's dynastic personality cult

### Similarities to [[ethiopia-mengistu]]

- Emergency/wartime justification for repression
- Mass conscription
- Single-party rule
- Suppression of regional/ethnic dissent
- Produced massive refugee outflows

**Key Difference:** Afwerki emerged from liberation struggle rather than coup

### Similarities to [[somalia-barre]]

- Horn of Africa regional dynamics
- War with Ethiopia as defining event
- Personalist authoritarian rule
- Produced large diaspora

**Key Difference:** Eritrea maintained state coherence rather than collapse

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Liberation to Tyranny:** Eritrea demonstrates how revolutionary movements can transform into totalitarian regimes, particularly when external threats provide justification for suspending democratic transitions.

2. **Conscription as Total Control:** Indefinite national service functions not primarily for defense but as a mechanism of population control, economic extraction, and prevention of independent civil society.

3. **Strategic Isolation:** Unlike most authoritarian regimes seeking legitimacy, Afwerki has pursued deliberate international isolation, expelling NGOs and journalists to eliminate accountability.

4. **War as Pretext:** Both the 1998-2000 Ethiopia war and the 2020-2022 Tigray intervention served domestic political purposes beyond military objectives.

5. **Succession Vacuum:** After 30+ years of personalist rule with no institutional development, Eritrea faces potentially destabilizing succession without mechanisms for peaceful transition.

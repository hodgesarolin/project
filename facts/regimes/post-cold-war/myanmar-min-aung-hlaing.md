## Overview

Senior General Min Aung Hlaing (born 1956) seized power in Myanmar on February 1, 2021, overthrowing the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD). The coup occurred the day before parliament was to convene following the NLD's landslide victory in the November 2020 elections. Min Aung Hlaing claimed electoral fraud, a claim rejected by the Union Election Commission and widely seen as a pretext for seizing power before his mandatory retirement. The coup triggered massive civil resistance (the Civil Disobedience Movement), armed resistance through People's Defense Forces, and has plunged Myanmar into civil war. The junta has committed widespread atrocities including airstrikes on civilians, village burnings, torture, and mass detention. The same military previously committed genocide against the Rohingya in 2016-2017, killing an estimated 24,000+ and displacing over 700,000 to Bangladesh. As of 2024-2025, the junta has suffered unprecedented territorial losses to resistance forces, particularly following Operation 1027 in October 2023, and has resorted to conscription amid collapsing morale.

## 1. Pre-Conditions for the Coup

### Colonial Legacy and Military Dominance

Burma (renamed Myanmar in 1989) was under direct military rule from 1962 to 2010. General Ne Win's 1962 coup established the "Burmese Way to Socialism," which isolated the country economically and politically for decades. The military (Tatmadaw) became the dominant institution in politics, economy, and society, creating what scholars describe as "extreme persistence of military rule"—widely regarded as the most durable military regime worldwide.

### The 2008 Constitution and Controlled Transition (2010-2011)

In 2008, the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) ratified a new constitution as part of a "roadmap to democracy." Key provisions:

- **25% reserved seats**: Military automatically receives 25% of all parliamentary seats without election
- **Presidential veto**: The constitution bars anyone with a foreign spouse or children from the presidency (specifically targeting Aung San Suu Kyi)
- **Military autonomy**: No civilian oversight of military operations, budget, or personnel
- **Emergency powers**: Article 417-418 allows the Commander-in-Chief to assume full state power during declared emergencies

The NLD boycotted the 2010 elections, which were widely regarded as rigged. Thein Sein, a former general, became president in 2011, overseeing a controlled liberalization.

### The Thein Sein Reform Era (2011-2015)

Under President Thein Sein, Myanmar underwent significant reforms:

- Release of political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest
- Establishment of National Human Rights Commission
- Relaxation of press censorship
- New labor laws allowing unions and strikes
- NLD allowed to register and contest elections
- ASEAN approved Myanmar's chairmanship bid for 2014

However, these reforms maintained military prerogatives. The 2008 Constitution ensured the military would retain power even under civilian government.

### 2015 Election: NLD Landslide Victory

In the first freely held elections in 25 years, the NLD won a historic supermajority:

- **86% of elected seats** (390 of 440 contested)
- **First non-military president in 54 years** (Htin Kyaw, as Suu Kyi was constitutionally barred)
- Aung San Suu Kyi became State Counsellor (de facto head of government)

The victory marked what many hoped would be Myanmar's democratic transition, though the military retained constitutional powers and economic interests.

### The Rohingya Genocide (2016-2017)

While Aung San Suu Kyi's government was in power, the Tatmadaw committed genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rakhine State:

**The August 2017 "Clearance Operations":**
- **Deaths**: At least 24,000 Rohingya killed, including 6,700+ in the first month alone
- **Sexual violence**: 18,000+ women and girls raped
- **Arson**: 392+ villages razed to the ground
- **Displacement**: 700,000+ fled to Bangladesh in weeks
- **Methods**: Extrajudicial killings, gang rapes, infanticides, burning people alive

**UN Findings:**
- A 2018 UN fact-finding mission found evidence of genocide and crimes against humanity
- Recommended six generals, including Min Aung Hlaing, face prosecution
- The ICJ (Gambia v. Myanmar) is adjudicating genocide claims
- In March 2022, the U.S. formally determined the atrocities constituted genocide

**Aung San Suu Kyi's Role:**
She defended the military at the ICJ in 2019, denying genocide. In February 2025, an Argentine court issued an arrest warrant against her for "genocide and crimes against humanity" against the Rohingya.

### 2020 Election: Even Larger NLD Victory

The November 8, 2020 election delivered another NLD landslide:

- **396 of 476 contested seats** (surpassing 2015)
- **USDP** (military proxy party): only 33 seats (fewer than 2015)
- Turnout: Approximately 72% despite COVID-19 pandemic

The military's Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) suffered a humiliating defeat. The Tatmadaw immediately claimed widespread fraud, alleging 8.6 million irregularities. The Union Election Commission categorically rejected these claims, citing lack of evidence.

## 2. The February 1, 2021 Coup

### The Seizure of Power

The coup occurred on February 1, 2021, the day before parliament was to swear in newly elected members:

**Timeline:**
- **Early morning**: Military detained State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and dozens of senior NLD officials in Naypyidaw
- **7:30 AM**: Internet cut nationwide
- **Declaration**: Vice President Myint Swe (military-aligned) declared himself Acting President
- **State of Emergency**: One-year emergency declared under Articles 417-418, transferring all power to Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing

The military alleged the November 2020 election was fraudulent and that the civilian government failed to address irregularities.

### Constitutional Illegality

Legal experts have conclusively determined the coup was unconstitutional:

1. **Article 417 violation**: Only a sitting president (not acting president) can declare emergency after consulting the full NDSC
2. **NDSC not properly convened**: The 11-member council requires both military and civilian members; civilians had been arrested
3. **No constitutional emergency existed**: Electoral disputes do not meet the threshold of "insurgency, violence and wrongful forcible means"
4. **Preemptive arrests**: Key civilian members were detained before any meeting could occur

The International Commission of Jurists found the military violated its own constitution.

### Min Aung Hlaing's Motivations

Beyond fraud claims, analysts identify personal motivations:

- **Retirement**: Min Aung Hlaing faced mandatory retirement at age 65 in July 2021
- **Successor selection**: The constitution empowered the president to appoint his successor
- **Accountability fears**: Potential prosecution for Rohingya genocide under a reform-minded successor
- **Economic interests**: NLD governance threatened military-dominated crony capitalism

## 4. Methods of Control

### State Administration Council (SAC)

On February 2, 2021, Min Aung Hlaing established the State Administration Council with 11 members as the executive governing body. The SAC centralized all legislative, executive, and judicial authority under military command.

### Martial Law

Martial law has been imposed in multiple areas:
- Six townships in Yangon
- Parts of Mandalay
- Resistance-heavy regions including Sagaing

Under martial law:
- Military commanders have "full administrative and judicial authority"
- Civilians tried by military courts
- Sentences include imprisonment, hard labor, and death penalty

### Economic Control and Crony Capitalism

The military controls vast economic interests through two conglomerates:

**Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL)** and **Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC)**:
- Near-monopolies in mining, manufacturing, banking, telecommunications, construction
- U.S. Treasury sanctioned both in March 2021
- Control extends to banking (KBZ Bank, AGD Bank, and others linked to military cronies)

**Revenue sources**:
- State-run Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise: ~$800 million per quarter in gas exports
- Pipelines to China and Thailand account for 10% of government revenue

## 10. International Response

### ASEAN Five-Point Consensus (April 2021)

On April 24, 2021, ASEAN leaders and Min Aung Hlaing agreed to:
1. Immediate end to violence
2. Dialogue among all parties
3. Special envoy appointment
4. ASEAN humanitarian assistance
5. Special envoy visit to Myanmar

**Failure**:
- Two days later, junta walked back commitment
- Violence escalated rather than ceased
- Indonesia's President Jokowi admitted "no significant progress"
- ASEAN itself acknowledged "lack of substantial progress" (September 2023)
- International Parliamentary Inquiry: "The Five-Point Consensus has failed"

ASEAN barred Min Aung Hlaing from summits starting October 2021—unprecedented censure.

### UN Security Council

**Resolution 2669 (December 21, 2022)**:
- First UNSC resolution on Myanmar since independence (1948)
- Adopted 12-0-3 (China, Russia, India abstained)
- Demanded end to violence, release of prisoners
- **No Chapter VII enforcement mechanism**
- **No sanctions** (removed from draft)
- **No arms embargo** (removed from draft)

Critics note it lacks "consequences for failure to meet demands."

### U.S. and Western Sanctions

**United States**:
- February 2021: Froze $1 billion government assets
- Targeted sanctions on Min Aung Hlaing and senior officials
- June 2023: Sanctioned state banks (MICB, MFTB)

**European Union**:
- Asset freezes, travel bans on junta officials
- Sanctioned military-owned enterprises

**Limited effectiveness**: Gas revenues continue; China and Russia provide arms and political cover.

## 11. Current Military Situation (2023-2025)

### Operation 1027 (October 2023)

On October 27, 2023, the **Three Brotherhood Alliance** (MNDAA, TNLA, Arakan Army) launched Operation 1027:

**Unprecedented Losses**:
- Army lost more territory faster than at any point in history
- 220+ junta positions captured by November 28, 2023
- 8 towns and 36 bases lost in first two months
- Kokang Self-Administered Zone fell completely

**Strategic Captures (2024)**:
- **Lashio**: Home of Northeastern Regional Command—first time a regional command fell
- **Ann**: Western Regional Command headquarters
- **88% of Rakhine State** under Arakan Army control

### Junta's Limited Recovery

Despite counteroffensives in 2024, the junta has reclaimed less than 1% of lost territory (Kawlin, Hsihseng, Twin Nge, Taunghkam).

### Force Strength Collapse

- **Pre-coup estimate**: 300,000-400,000 troops
- **Late 2023**: ~130,000 (some estimates as low as 100,000)
- **Current effective strength** (USIP estimate): ~150,000, with less than half frontline capable

### Conscription (2024)

In February 2024, the junta activated the dormant 1959 **People's Military Service Law**:

**Requirements**:
- Men 18-35, women 18-27 must serve 2 years minimum
- Extendable to 5 years during emergency
- Evasion punishable by 5 years imprisonment

**Targets**: 60,000 conscripts annually

**Response**:
- Mass panic; unprecedented queues at passport offices and embassies
- Many young men joined PDF instead
- 37+ local officials involved in conscription killed by April 2024
- Less than 5% of conscripts volunteered (despite junta claims of 60%)

### Defections and Surrenders

- **15,000+** police and military have defected or surrendered since the coup
- **4,000+ surrendered** during Operation 1027 alone
- **6 Tatmadaw generals** surrendered as of February 2024
- **430 soldiers** including a lieutenant colonel surrendered in one Light Infantry Battalion

Defectors cite plunging morale, supply shortages, and unanswered calls for reinforcement.

### State of Emergency Extensions

Min Aung Hlaing has repeatedly extended the state of emergency:
- **January 31, 2025**: Extended for another 6 months
- Elections repeatedly promised but postponed
- Current justification: "peace and stability needed before elections"

## 12. Aung San Suu Kyi: Trials and Detention

### Arrest and Initial Charges

Arrested on February 1, 2021, Aung San Suu Kyi faced a cascade of politically motivated charges:

### Convictions (2021-2022)

### Current Detention Conditions

- **Location**: Specially built structure within Naypyidaw Prison (disputed claims of house arrest transfer in April 2024)
- **Isolation**: Near-total isolation from outside world
- **Access**: No radio; receives some English and French books
- **Contact**: Son Kim Aris has not heard directly from her in years

### Total Time in Detention

As of January 2025, Aung San Suu Kyi has spent a total of **19 years in detention** across her lifetime—first under previous juntas, now under Min Aung Hlaing.

### International Condemnation

The UN, EU, U.S., and human rights organizations have condemned all trials as politically motivated and lacking transparency.

### Argentine Arrest Warrant

On February 14, 2025, an Argentine court issued an arrest warrant against Aung San Suu Kyi (along with Min Aung Hlaing and others) for "genocide and crimes against humanity" against the Rohingya, under universal jurisdiction.

## 13. Scholarly Debates

### Nature of the Tatmadaw and Authoritarian Persistence

Myanmar represents an extreme case of **authoritarian durability**. Scholars note:

- The Tatmadaw controlled state, politics, economy, and society before, during, and after the 2011-2021 transition
- The 2008 Constitution was designed to ensure military prominence regardless of election outcomes
- Burma/Myanmar is "generally regarded as the most durable military regime worldwide"

The 2021 coup demonstrates the limits of "guided democratization" when the military retains constitutional veto powers and economic interests.

### Responsibility to Protect (R2P) Failure

Myanmar presents a comprehensive case study in **R2P failure**:

**Structural obstacles**:
- China and Russia block Security Council action
- Veto threat prevents referral to ICC
- ASEAN's non-interference norm limits regional response

**Continuity of impunity**:
- Failure to hold Tatmadaw accountable for Rohingya genocide enabled the 2021 coup
- Same perpetrators now rule the country
- International community's "paralysis of indifference" (UN Special Rapporteur)

**Key questions raised**:
- Should international community support armed civilian resistance?
- Are civilians justified in taking up arms against atrocity-committing governments?
- Does R2P have meaning without enforcement mechanisms?

### Revolutionary Resistance Under Full Autocratization

Recent research highlights Myanmar's resistance as a model of countering authoritarian consolidation:

- The CDM, PDFs, and ethnic alliances deploy "mutually reinforcing strategies of economic, symbolic, political, and armed resistance"
- Unlike typical coup aftermaths, resistance has grown rather than diminished
- Demonstrates that civil resistance remains central even under full autocratization, but armed resistance may be necessary to counter extreme repression

## 14. Comparisons and Connections

### Regional Military Regimes

Myanmar's junta shares characteristics with other Southeast Asian military governments:

- **[[thailand-military]]**: Pattern of coups, constitutional manipulation, and royal-military alliance; Thailand's 2014 coup showed similar constitutional maneuvering
- **Indonesia under Suharto**: Military economic conglomerates (MEHL/MEC parallel to Suharto-era military businesses); New Order's "dual function" doctrine
- **Philippines under Marcos**: Martial law, crony capitalism, and prolonged emergency rule

### Genocide Comparisons

The Rohingya genocide invites comparison with other state-perpetrated atrocities:

- **[[cambodia-khmer-rouge]]**: Ethnic cleansing, mass displacement, and international community's delayed response
- **Rwanda 1994**: Rapid mass killing, international failure to intervene, subsequent accountability efforts
- **Srebrenica**: Mass killing despite international presence; R2P failure

### Authoritarian Resilience

Myanmar demonstrates patterns seen in other durable authoritarian regimes:

- **[[myanmar-ne-win]]**: The institutional foundations laid by Ne Win's 1962-1988 military rule persisted through the transition era
- **Egypt under Sisi**: Military's economic empire and constitutional guarantees
- **Pakistan**: Recurring pattern of military intervention and guided transitions

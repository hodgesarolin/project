# Alberto Fujimori's Peru (1990-2000)

> "My government is the product of rejection, of being fed up with Peru because of the frivolity, corruption and nonfunctioning of the traditional political class and the bureaucracy." — Alberto Fujimori[^cja]

## Overview

Alberto Kenya Fujimori Inomoto (1938-2024) served as Peru's president from 1990 to 2000. His regime represents a paradigmatic case of **electoral authoritarianism** in Latin America—a leader who came to power through democratic elections, consolidated control through a self-coup (autogolpe), rewrote the constitution, defeated terrorist insurgencies, implemented radical economic reforms, and ultimately fell due to corruption scandals. He became the first democratically elected head of state to be tried and convicted of human rights violations in his own country.[^hrw-conviction]

## I. Pre-Conditions: The "Lost Decade" (1980-1990)

### Economic Collapse Under Alan Garcia

Peru's "Lost Decade" of the 1980s created the conditions for Fujimori's rise. Under President Alan Garcia (1985-1990), Peru experienced catastrophic economic mismanagement:[^wiki-lost-decade][^wiki-garcia]

- **Hyperinflation**: Reached 7,649% in 1990, with cumulative inflation of 2,200,200% over five years
- **Currency collapse**: The Peruvian inti required banknotes printed up to 5,000,000 intis
- **Foreign debt**: Increased to $19 billion by 1989
- **GDP contraction**: Real GDP fell 25% from 1987-1990
- **Poverty surge**: Rose from 41.6% to over 70%
- **International isolation**: Garcia unilaterally limited debt repayment to 10% of GNP, cutting Peru off from international credit markets[^imf-peru]

### The Shining Path Insurgency

The Maoist guerrilla group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), led by philosophy professor Abimael Guzman, launched its armed struggle in 1980:[^wiki-shining-path]

- **Death toll**: The internal conflict (1980-2000) caused an estimated 69,280 deaths and disappearances[^cvr]
- **Shining Path responsibility**: 54% of total deaths
- **Economic damage**: Over $20 billion in infrastructure destruction
- **Territorial control**: By 1990, the Shining Path controlled significant rural areas and had begun urban terrorism

### State Failure

By 1990, Peru represented a near-failed state:[^ucla-debt]
- Democratic institutions discredited
- Traditional parties (APRA, Accion Popular) rejected by voters
- Military unable to defeat insurgency
- Basic services collapsed in many areas

---

## II. Rise to Power (1990)

### The Outsider Campaign

Alberto Fujimori emerged as a dark horse candidate in the 1990 election:[^wiki-fujimori][^cja]

- **Background**: Son of Japanese immigrants, agronomist, university rector at La Molina Agricultural University
- **Party**: Cambio 90 ("Change 90") - a hastily assembled vehicle with no political infrastructure
- **Nickname**: "El Chino" (despite being of Japanese descent) - embraced as a term of endearment
- **Campaign style**: Rode tractors and bicycles through Lima rallies, presenting himself as a man of the people
- **Polling**: Rose from 6% one month before the election to second place

### Defeat of Mario Vargas Llosa

The runoff pitted Fujimori against renowned novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who led a coalition of traditional parties:[^nbcnews-obit][^cbsnews-obit]

- **Vargas Llosa's platform**: Open advocacy of IMF-style shock therapy
- **Fujimori's appeal**: Rejected harsh austerity (which he would later implement)
- **Coalition**: Evangelical Christians, informal sector workers, rural poor
- **Result**: Fujimori won decisively in the June 1990 runoff

> "He soared from 6% in the polls a month before the 1990 election to finish second out of nine in the balloting. He went on to beat Vargas Llosa in a runoff."[^nbcnews-obit]

---

## III. The Autogolpe (April 5, 1992)

### The Self-Coup

On the night of April 5, 1992, Fujimori executed a self-coup ("autogolpe" or "Fujimorazo"):[^wiki-autogolpe][^infobae-autogolpe]

- **Television announcement**: Declared "temporary dissolution" of Congress and "reorganization" of the judiciary
- **Military action**: Army tanks deployed to Congress; tear gas used against senators attempting to hold session
- **Arrests**: Opposition leaders and journalists detained, including Gustavo Gorriti
- **Justification**: Congressional obstruction of anti-terrorism and economic reform measures

### Public Response

The coup received overwhelming domestic support:[^wiki-autogolpe]
- **Approval rating**: Nearly 80% of Peruvians supported the autogolpe
- **Congressional response**: Formally removed Fujimori and swore in VP Maximo San Roman—who was never recognized as de facto president
- **International reaction**: Initial condemnation from OAS and US, followed by acceptance within two weeks

### Constitutional Rewrite (1993)

Fujimori convened a Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) to draft a new constitution:[^wiki-constitution][^constitutionnet]

- **CCD elections** (November 1992): Fujimori's Cambio 90-Nueva Mayoria won 72 of 80 seats
- **Referendum** (October 31, 1993): Passed narrowly with 52.3% approval (amid allegations of irregularities)
- **Key changes**:
  - Unicameral Congress (120 members, later 130)
  - Expanded presidential powers
  - Allowed consecutive presidential reelection
  - Economic liberalization provisions

---

## IV. Methods of Control

### The SIN and Vladimiro Montesinos

Fujimori's de facto co-ruler was intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos Torres:[^wiki-montesinos][^harvard-case]

- **Position**: Head of Servicio de Inteligencia Nacional (SIN)
- **Power**: "Widely regarded as the power behind the throne"
- **CIA connection**: Received at least $10 million from the CIA (1990-2000) for counter-narcotics work[^public-integrity]
- **Control network**: Systematically bribed politicians, judges, military officers, and media owners

### The Vladivideos

Montesinos obsessively recorded his bribery sessions on videotape:[^sfgate][^wiki-montesinos]

- **Purpose**: To ensure complicity of bribe-takers through mutual incrimination
- **Scale**: Over 75% of SIN's unsupervised budget used to bribe 1,600+ individuals
- **Monthly payments**: Over $3.5 million to congressmen, judges, and media executives
- **Media control**: TV channel owners received $1.5 million/month; Montesinos held daily meetings to plan nightly news coverage

> "They [the broadcast channels] are all lined up. Every day I have a meeting with them and we plan what is going to come out in the nightly news shows." — Montesinos[^cpj-peru]

### Judiciary Manipulation

The regime systematically undermined judicial independence:[^hrw-1993]
- Constitutional Court justices who ruled against Fujimori's third term were dismissed
- Judges received bribes or faced intimidation
- Amnesty laws protected human rights violators (later repealed)

---

## V. Counter-Terrorism Operations

### Capture of Abimael Guzman (September 12, 1992)

The elite police unit GEIN (Grupo Especial de Inteligencia) achieved a decisive victory:[^wiki-guzman][^andina-gein]

- **Operation Victoria**: GEIN tracked Guzman to an apartment in Lima's Surquillo district
- **Intelligence work**: Analyzed garbage for psoriasis medication tubes (Guzman's known condition)
- **Impact**: "A turning point in the struggle against terrorism"—first capture of an active terrorist organization's leadership in world history
- **Aftermath**: Shining Path leadership rapidly collapsed; Guzman later called for peace talks

### Defeat of the Shining Path

By the mid-1990s, the Shining Path was effectively defeated:[^npr-guzman]
- Rural rondas campesinas (peasant patrols) organized against the insurgency
- Mass arrests and trials (often criticized for due process violations)
- Military/police operations in highland regions

### Japanese Embassy Hostage Crisis (1996-1997)

The MRTA (Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement) staged a dramatic hostage crisis:[^wiki-embassy][^wiki-chavin]

**Crisis (December 17, 1996):**
- 14 MRTA guerrillas stormed Japanese Ambassador's residence during Emperor Akihito's birthday celebration
- 600+ hostages initially taken, including diplomats, military officers, businessmen
- Demand: Release of 400 imprisoned MRTA members

**Operation Chavin de Huantar (April 22, 1997):**
- 142 commandos entered through tunnels dug over months
- Attack timed during rebels' daily indoor soccer game
- Duration: 22 minutes
- Result: All 14 MRTA members killed; 71 of 72 hostages rescued; 1 hostage and 2 commandos died

**Controversy**: Inter-American Commission on Human Rights found Peru responsible for summary execution of surrendered MRTA members.[^world-prx]

---

## VI. Human Rights Atrocities

### Grupo Colina Death Squad

Grupo Colina operated directly under SIN/military command:[^wiki-colina]

- **Leadership**: Army Major Santiago Martin Rivas
- **Command**: Reported to Montesinos and military high command
- **Methods**: Targeted killings, disappearances, torture

### Forced Sterilization Program (1996-2000)

The PNSRPF (National Reproductive Health and Family Planning Program) conducted mass sterilizations:[^wiki-sterilization][^ohchr-sterilization][^amnesty-sterilization]

**Scale:**
- Over 300,000 women sterilized (primarily tubal ligations)
- Approximately 25,000 men sterilized (vasectomies)
- 59% of analyzed medical records showed missing/incomplete consent

**Targeting:**

---

## VII. Economic Policy: The "Fujishock"

### Implementation (August 8, 1990)

Ten days after taking office, Fujimori implemented shock therapy far more extreme than he had campaigned against:[^wiki-economic][^country-data][^ucla-debt]

**Immediate measures:**
- Gasoline prices increased 3,000%
- Subsidies eliminated overnight
- Currency devalued over 100%
- Price controls removed
- Trade tariffs reduced from 66% average to 17%

> "On August 8, 1990, Fujimori implemented precisely the program that he had campaigned against. The shock program was more extreme than even the most orthodox IMF economist was recommending at the time."[^ucla-debt]

### Privatization

Massive state asset sales:[^wiki-economic]
- Hundreds of state-owned enterprises privatized
- Currency replaced: Inti replaced by Nuevo Sol
- Improvements in telecommunications, telephony, internet

### Results

**Positive indicators:**

---

## VIII. Corruption: The Montesinos Network

**Estimated totals:**
- Joel Segura (anti-corruption prosecutor): Over $600 million stolen
- Prime Minister Carlos Ferrero: Total exceeded $1 billion
- Arms deal kickbacks: 18% commissions on 32+ transactions
- MiG-29 purchase: $10.9 million in "commissions" from Russian sale

---

## IX. The Fall (2000)

### The Controversial Third Term

Fujimori sought an unconstitutional third term:[^wiki-2000-election][^britannica]

- **Constitutional issue**: 1993 Constitution limited presidents to two terms
- **Legal argument**: Claimed 1993 Constitution didn't count his first term (since it predated the new constitution)
- **Judicial manipulation**: Dismissed Constitutional Court justices who ruled against him

### The 2000 Election

The election was widely considered fraudulent:[^wiki-2000-election]
- **First round** (April 9): No candidate achieved majority
- **Opposition withdrawal**: Alejandro Toledo withdrew from runoff, citing fraud
- **Result**: Fujimori "won" with 74% of vote—running virtually unopposed
- **International condemnation**: OAS, United States, and growing domestic opposition

### The Vladivideo Scandal

On September 14, 2000, the regime collapsed:[^wiki-fujimori][^aljazeera-profile]

- **The video**: Canal N broadcast footage of Montesinos bribing opposition congressman Alberto Kouri ($15,000 to defect)
- **48-hour response**: Fujimori called new elections, fired Montesinos, promised to dismantle SIN
- **Cascade**: Hundreds more vladivideos emerged showing systematic bribery

### Flight and Fax Resignation

In November 2000, Fujimori fled:[^cnn-obit][^npr-obit]

- **Pretext**: Official visit to APEC summit in Brunei, then to Japan
- **The fax**: Sent resignation from Tokyo hotel
- **Congressional response**: Rejected resignation; declared him "morally unfit"; voted him out of office
- **Japanese citizenship**: Fujimori held dual citizenship by birth; Japan refused extradition requests

---

## X. Trial and Conviction

### Arrest in Chile (November 2005)

After five years in Japanese exile, Fujimori made a surprise move:[^wiki-arrest][^hrw-chile]

- **Arrest**: Detained by Chilean authorities
- **Extradition**: Supreme Court of Chile approved extradition (September 21, 2007)
- **Historic precedent**: First time a court ordered extradition of a former head of state for human rights violations to his home country

- December 2007: 6 years for illegal search and seizure (autogolpe-related)
- Additional convictions for corruption, embezzlement

---

## XI. Pardon, Release, and Death

### The Christmas Pardon (2017)

President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori on December 24, 2017:[^wiki-pardon]
- **Justification**: Humanitarian grounds (health issues)
- **Political context**: Occurred amid impeachment threats from Keiko Fujimori's party
- **Annulment**: Supreme Court overturned the pardon (2018)

### Constitutional Court Restoration (2022-2023)

The pardon's status remained contested:[^france24][^npr-release]
- March 2022: Constitutional Court (4-3) reinstated the pardon

---

## XII. Legacy and Family

### Keiko Fujimori

- **Electoral base**: Continues to win 30-40% in presidential elections
- **Legacy debates**: Supporters credit him with defeating terrorism and stabilizing economy; critics emphasize human rights crimes

### Polarizing Figure

> "He remains a polarizing figure in Peru, and there is no consensus about whether his legacy is primarily positive or negative."[^wiki-fujimori]

---

## XIII. Scholarly Debates

### Delegative Democracy vs. Electoral Authoritarianism

Scholars have debated how to classify the Fujimori regime:[^levitsky-pdf][^psupress][^jstor-fujimori]

**Before the 1992 autogolpe:**
- Guillermo O'Donnell's "delegative democracy": Personalistic, plebiscitarian leader with weak horizontal accountability[^o'donnell-dd]
- Majoritarian conception of rule; executive unconstrained by legislature/judiciary

**After the autogolpe:**
- Steven Levitsky developed "competitive authoritarianism" partly based on Peru[^levitsky-pdf]
- Regime maintained electoral facade while systematically undermining democratic institutions
- Other classifications: "illiberal democracy" (Zakaria), "electoral authoritarianism" (Schedler)

### The Neopopulism Debate

Fujimori exemplifies the paradox of neoliberal populism:[^researchgate-neopopulism][^library-fes]
- Populist rhetoric and outsider appeal
- Implementation of orthodox neoliberal economics
- Kenneth Roberts' typology: "populist outsider" who filled vacuum left by collapsed parties
- Anti-corruption crusade as mobilizing frame

### Comparisons to Contemporary Leaders

Fujimori is frequently compared to modern authoritarian populists:[^idea-int][^csmonitor]

**Nayib Bukele (El Salvador):**
- Outsider rejection of traditional parties
- Security justification for rights abuses
- Popular support despite democratic erosion

**Javier Milei (Argentina):**
- Shock therapy economics
- Anti-establishment rhetoric

> "He was Milei before Milei. Bukele before Bukele. Chavez before Chavez." — Gonzalo Banda, Peruvian political scientist[^csmonitor]

### The Security-Democracy Tradeoff

Fujimori's legacy raises fundamental questions:[^idea-int]
- Can authoritarian methods be justified against existential threats?
- Does defeating terrorism legitimate human rights violations?
- How do societies reckon with leaders who delivered security through repression?

---

## XIV. Truth and Reconciliation

### The CVR (2001-2003)

Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission documented the internal conflict:[^wiki-cvr][^usip][^nsarchive]

**Key findings:**
- 69,280 deaths and disappearances (1980-2000)
- Shining Path: 54% of deaths
- MRTA: 1.5% of deaths
- State forces: ~37% of deaths
- 40% of victims from Ayacucho region
- Majority of victims were Indigenous civilians

**Recommendations:**
- Reparations for victims
- Institutional reforms
- Criminal prosecutions

### Ongoing Justice Efforts

As of 2024-2025:[^theconversation]
- Forced sterilization cases proceeding in Inter-American Court
- Victims' families continue seeking accountability
- Fujimori's death does not end legal cases against other perpetrators

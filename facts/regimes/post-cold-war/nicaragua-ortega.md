# Daniel Ortega's Nicaragua (2007-Present)

## Executive Summary

Daniel Ortega, once a revolutionary hero who helped overthrow the Somoza dictatorship in 1979, has transformed Nicaragua into a family-controlled authoritarian state. After losing power democratically in 1990, he returned to the presidency in 2007 through strategic pacts with former enemies and constitutional manipulation. Following the brutal suppression of 2018 protests (355+ dead), Ortega accelerated his consolidation of power, culminating in a 2025 constitutional reform establishing a co-presidency with his wife Rosario Murillo and abolishing separation of powers. The regime now exhibits characteristics strikingly similar to the Somoza dynasty it once replaced.

---

## I. Pre-Conditions and Historical Background

### A. The Sandinista Revolution (1979)

On July 19, 1979, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) overthrew the U.S.-backed Somoza family dictatorship that had ruled Nicaragua since 1937. Daniel Ortega was one of the original nine *comandantes* of the FSLN.[^1]

**Key Context:**
- The Somoza dynasty had controlled Nicaragua for 42 years (1937-1979)
- The revolution was a broad coalition including Marxists, liberals, Catholics, and business leaders
- Ortega became coordinator of the ruling junta in 1981 and was elected president in 1984

> "The triumph of the Sandinista revolution in 1979 was heralded as a victory by millions throughout the world who were tired of the United States superpower using Central Americans as Cold War cannon fodder."[^2]

**Revolutionary Ideology:** Sandinista ideology "blended Marxism, liberalism, and nationalism, borrowing ideas from both sides of the Iron Curtain" and "its architects saw no contradiction between revolutionary policy and democratic governance."[^3]

### B. The Contra War (1981-1990)

The Reagan administration viewed the Sandinistas as a Soviet threat in America's backyard and funded the *Contras* (counterrevolutionaries) to destabilize the government.[^4]

**Key Facts:**
- Reagan signed National Security Directive 17 in November 1981 authorizing covert support for anti-Sandinista forces
- The Boland Amendment (1982) prohibited U.S. funds for overthrowing the Sandinistas
- The Iran-Contra Affair revealed illegal arms sales to fund the Contras after Congress banned military aid in 1984
- **Death toll:** Approximately 30,865 killed[^5]
- Economic devastation and the military draft became deeply unpopular

### C. The 1990 Electoral Defeat

On February 25, 1990, Ortega lost to Violeta Chamorro of the National Opposition Union (UNO) coalition, receiving 41% to her 54.7%.[^6]

**Why Ortega Lost:**
- War exhaustion and economic collapse
- U.S. economic embargo and threat of continued conflict
- Chamorro positioned herself as the "peace candidate"
- The unpopular military draft

**Critical Legacy:** This defeat "shaped Ortega's political and electoral strategies ever since."[^7] He would ensure he never lost power through elections again.

**The "Pinata":** During the transition, Sandinista leaders transferred expropriated state property to themselves, enriching the party elite in what became known as the *pinata sandinista*.[^8]

### D. El Pacto: The Aleman-Ortega Pact (1999-2000)

In 1999, Ortega struck a deal with corrupt Liberal President Arnoldo Aleman that fundamentally reshaped Nicaraguan politics.[^9]

**Key Provisions:**
- **Lowered electoral threshold:** From 45% to 40% (or 35% with 5-point lead) to win without runoff - tailored to Ortega's ~40% electoral ceiling
- **Institutional capture:** Supreme Court expanded from 12 to 16 justices; Supreme Electoral Council expanded from 5 to 7 members - with seats divided between FSLN and PLC
- **Mutual protection:** Designed to shield Aleman from corruption prosecution

> "The 2014 reforms concentrated power far more than the constitutions from the era of the Somoza dictatorship."[^10]

---

## II. Return to Power (2006)

### A. The 2006 Election Victory

Ortega won the presidency on November 5, 2006 with just 38% of the vote - made possible only by the constitutional changes of El Pacto.[^11]

**Strategic Transformations:**

1. **Religious Alliance:** In 2005, Ortega married his longtime partner Rosario Murillo in a Catholic ceremony presided over by Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo - his former nemesis. He supported a total abortion ban to win Church endorsement.[^12]

2. **Contra Alliance:** Selected former Contra leader Jaime Morales Carazo as his vice-presidential running mate

3. **Business Alliance:** Reached accommodation with COSEP (Superior Council of Private Enterprise), promising market-friendly policies

4. **Ideological Rebrand:** Abandoned revolutionary rhetoric, emphasized "peace and reconciliation," added "God" alongside "Revolution" in speeches

> "Ortega and his wife metamorphosed into devout Catholics after decades of revolutionary atheism."[^13]

---

## III. Methods of Control

### A. Constitutional Manipulation

**2009 Supreme Court Ruling:**
The Sandinista-controlled Supreme Court ruled that term limits violated Ortega's human rights, allowing him to run for reelection in 2011. Opposition magistrates were excluded and replaced with Sandinista substitutes to achieve quorum.[^14]

**2014 Constitutional Reforms:**
- Eliminated all term limits (indefinite reelection)
- Removed minimum vote threshold for first-round victory
- Granted president power to rule by decree
- Allowed president to keep officials in positions indefinitely[^15]

**2025 Constitutional Overhaul:**
- Established co-presidency (male and female co-presidents)
- Extended presidential terms from 5 to 6 years
- **Abolished separation of powers** - executive now "coordinates" legislature, judiciary, and electoral branch
- Created "Volunteer Police" auxiliary force (15,000+ civilians with covered faces)[^16]

### B. The Ortega-Murillo Family Dynasty

Rosario Murillo has served as First Lady (2007-2017), Vice President (2017-2025), and now Co-President (2025-present).[^17]

**Dynastic Succession:**
- The 2025 constitution specifies a male and female co-president
- Upon Ortega's death or incapacity, Murillo automatically becomes president
- Son Laureano Ortega Murillo is positioned as likely successor through vice-presidential appointment
- Eight children with Ortega form part of the inner circle[^18]

> "The establishment of a co-presidency in Nicaragua represents a significant milestone in the country's descent into authoritarianism. What was once a revolutionary government has now cemented itself as a family-controlled regime."[^19]

**Historical Irony:** Ortega overthrew the Somoza dynasty (1937-1979). He now leads a family dynasty of his own.

### C. Judiciary and Electoral Capture

**Judiciary:**
- Over 70% of judges have ties to the FSLN[^20]
- Supreme Court rubber-stamps regime decisions
- Courts used to prosecute opposition figures on fabricated charges

**Electoral Council:**
- Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) controlled by Sandinista appointees
- Opposition parties banned or their legal status annulled
- Election results predetermined[^21]

---

## IV. The 2018 Uprising

### A. Origins

On April 18, 2018, protests erupted against social security reforms that increased taxes and decreased benefits. What began as pension protests by retirees quickly expanded into a nationwide uprising driven by accumulated grievances.[^22]

### B. Death Toll and Repression

**Casualties:**
- **355+ killed** (IACHR figure)[^23]
- **2,000+ injured**
- **2,000+ arbitrarily detained**
- 21 police officers and 24 children/adolescents among the dead

**Methods:**
- Live ammunition used against protesters
- Pro-government paramilitary groups (*turbas*) deployed alongside police
- "Sandinista Youth" members armed by authorities
- GIEI-Nicaragua identified instances meeting international definitions of **crimes against humanity**[^24]

**Aftermath:**
- Political demonstrations declared illegal (September 2018)
- OHCHR expelled after releasing critical report
- No accountability: only one conviction of a pro-government militia member; zero investigations of security forces[^25]

---

## V. The 2021 Sham Election

### A. Pre-Election Crackdown

Between June and July 2021, the regime arrested **seven presidential candidates** and dozens of other opposition figures:[^26]

| Candidate | Date Arrested | Sentence |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Cristiana Chamorro Barrios | June 2, 2021 | 8 years |
| Arturo Cruz Jr. | June 5, 2021 | 9 years |
| Felix Maradiaga | June 8, 2021 | 13 years |
| Juan Sebastian Chamorro | June 8, 2021 | 13 years |
| Miguel Mora | June 20, 2021 | 13 years |
| Medardo Mairena | July 2021 | 13 years |
| Noel Vidaurre | July 2021 | 9 years |

**Legal Basis:** "Law 1055" (December 2020) - the "Guillotine Law" - criminalized "inciting foreign interference" and "attacking sovereignty."[^27]

### B. The Election

On November 7, 2021, with all viable opposition candidates jailed or exiled:
- Official result: Ortega-Murillo won with 75.9%
- International community declared it neither free nor fair
- U.S., UK, Canada, EU imposed sanctions[^28]

---

## VI. Religious Persecution

### A. The Bishop Rolando Alvarez Case

Bishop Rolando Alvarez of Matagalpa became the highest-profile target of religious persecution.[^29]

**Timeline:**
- August 4, 2022: Police prevent him from celebrating Mass
- August 19, 2022: Arrested without warrant along with 7 other clergy
- February 9, 2023: Refuses exile with 222 other deportees, choosing to stay with his flock
- February 10, 2023: Sentenced to **26 years and 4 months** for "treason"
- January 14, 2024: Released and exiled to Vatican after 500+ days detention[^30]

### B. Systematic Church Persecution

Since 2018, the regime has waged war on the Catholic Church, which provided shelter and aid to injured protesters:[^31]

**Scale of Persecution:**
- **154+ bishops, priests, deacons, seminarians** forced out
- **91+ nuns** expelled or unable to work
- **4 bishops** now in exile (of 8 total plus 1 cardinal)
- **136 priests** expelled
- **14+ lay Catholics** imprisoned for religious reasons

**Key Actions:**
- June 2022: Missionaries of Charity (Mother Teresa's order) expelled; 18 nuns deported
- August 2023: **Jesuits banned**, all assets confiscated
- 2024: **All nuns ordered to leave the country**
- November 2024: Priests barred from administering last rites in hospitals
- Religious processions banned outside church property[^32]

---

## VII. Broader Repression

### A. The February 2023 Mass Deportation

On February 9, 2023, **222 political prisoners** were stripped of citizenship and deported to the United States in a negotiated release:[^33]

- Included presidential candidates, journalists, civic leaders, students
- All declared "traitors" by Nicaraguan courts
- Congress approved constitutional change allowing citizenship revocation
- 94 additional Nicaraguans stripped of citizenship same day
- **450+ total** stripped of citizenship since 2023[^34]

**Bishop Alvarez notably refused to board the plane**, choosing imprisonment over exile.

### B. Civil Society Destruction

**NGO Closures:**
- **5,600+ NGOs closed** (80% of all organizations in country)[^35]
- Targets include: Save the Children, cancer foundations, HIV/AIDS organizations, Rotary Club, chess federation
- **1,500+ religious organizations** lost legal status (Catholic, Protestant)

**University Shutdowns:**
- **28+ universities closed** since 2018[^36]
- **August 2023:** Central American University (UCA) seized, assets confiscated, renamed as state institution
- 5,000+ students displaced
- 2,000+ students and academics fled abroad
- UCA described as "last bastion of critical thinking" before closure

> "We are in a stage of consolidation of totalitarianism in education. It is no exaggeration to say there is no university in Nicaragua anymore."[^37]

**Media:**
- 58+ media outlets shuttered
- Journalists imprisoned or exiled
- Independent media effectively eliminated

---

## VIII. Revolutionary to Dictator: Ideological Transformation

### A. The "Revolution Betrayed" Thesis

When Ortega returned to power in 2007, the FSLN "was no longer the revolutionary party with the socialist program of the past."[^38]

**Key Alliances:**
- **COSEP (Business Elite):** 2006 policy document drafted in coordination with business council promised "respect for all forms of property," free trade, and attracting transnational investment
- **Catholic Church:** Abortion ban, public religiosity, marriage in Church
- **Former Contras:** Vice-presidential alliance
- **IMF/World Bank:** Praised for neoliberal reforms; debt cancellation in exchange for structural adjustment[^39]

**Economic Model:**
- Combined social welfare programs with neoliberal economics
- Lowest wages in Latin America (outside Cuba)
- 96% of property now in private hands (vs. significant state/cooperative sector in 1980s)
- Free trade zones for foreign investment[^40]

### B. The 2018 Break

The pension reform that triggered the 2018 uprising was an IMF demand that broke the Ortega-COSEP accommodation. The regime chose repression over compromise, accelerating its transformation into pure dictatorship.[^41]

### C. Scholarly Analysis

Karl Marx's observation about Louis Bonaparte - "first as tragedy, then as farce" - has been applied to describe "the saga of Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega's conversion... from a socialist revolutionary to a repressive and corrupt petty dictator."[^42]

> "Former Uruguayan president Jose 'Pepe' Mujica stated: 'I feel that what was a dream has gone off track, fallen into autocracy, and I understand that those who in the past were revolutionaries have lost their way.'"[^43]

---

## IX. International Relations

### A. Russia

Nicaragua has become Russia's primary ally in Central America:[^44]

- **3,500+ Russian military personnel** have entered since 2016
- Russian-run police training center established
- Military exercises and "humanitarian operations" authorized (June 2022)
- December 2024: New military cooperation agreement signed
- GLONASS satellite station (espionage concerns)
- Son Laureano Ortega Murillo: "Nicaragua is Russia's strategic ally in Central America"[^45]

### B. China

Relations restored December 2021 (breaking ties with Taiwan):[^46]

- Trade agreement covering 90% of previous Taiwan exports
- May 2025: China supplying military equipment through Poly Technologies (U.S.-sanctioned company)
- June 2023: Riot gear donated to National Police

### C. International Isolation

**OAS Withdrawal:**
- November 2021: Announced withdrawal following election criticism
- November 2023: Withdrawal effective - second country to leave (after Venezuela)
- April 2022: OAS offices in Managua seized by police[^47]

**Sanctions:**
- U.S., UK, Canada, EU sanctions on regime officials
- Entry bans on Ortega and Murillo

**UN Findings:**
- March 2023: UN report concluded Ortega-Murillo committed **crimes against humanity**
- Expert Jan-Michael Simon compared the regime to Nazi Germany[^48]

---

## X. Current Status (2025)

### A. Ongoing Consolidation

As of early 2025, the Ortega-Murillo regime has achieved near-total control:[^49]

- **Co-presidency** constitutionally established
- **Separation of powers** formally abolished
- 15,000+ "Volunteer Police" civilians sworn in (faces covered)
- State now officially "revolutionary" and based on "Christianity and socialism"
- Freedom House: Nicaragua has the **steepest 10-year decline in freedom** of any country worldwide[^50]

### B. The Exile Community

**Scale:**
- **440,000+ Nicaraguans** sought asylum abroad (2018-2023 UNHCR data)
- Costa Rica hosts 280,000+ forcibly displaced Nicaraguans
- 194,000 pending asylum claims in Costa Rica alone (83% of all claims)
- Nicaraguan refugees = ~4% of Costa Rica's population[^51]

**Challenges:**
- 2025 funding crisis: UNHCR Costa Rica budget cut 41%
- U.S. humanitarian funding dropped from $23.1M (2024) to <$500K (2025)
- Average asylum processing time: 4+ years
- Growing hostility to refugees in host countries[^52]

---

## XI. Scholarly Debates

### A. Revolutionary Movements and Authoritarianism

The Nicaraguan case illuminates broader questions about revolutionary movements' relationship to democracy:

**The "Revolution Betrayed" Framework:**
- Some scholars see Ortega's transformation as a personal betrayal of revolutionary ideals
- Fernando Cardenal called it "a colossal ethical collapse and betrayal"[^53]

**Structural Critique:**
- Other scholars argue this framing avoids examining "how the Sandinista revolution's own failings might have helped open the way for its unraveling"
- Issues include: gender inequality, elite capture, demobilization of popular bases, accommodation with capital[^54]

### B. Comparative Cases

Nicaragua fits a pattern of revolutionary movements becoming authoritarian:

| Case | Revolution | Authoritarian Turn |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| Nicaragua (Ortega) | 1979 | 2007+ (accelerating 2018+) |
| [[venezuela-maduro]] | 1999 (Chavez) | 2013+ (accelerating 2017+) |
| [[cuba-castro]] | 1959 | 1960s+ |

**Key Variables:**
- Personalization of power
- Erosion of internal party democracy
- Accommodation with capital while maintaining leftist rhetoric
- External pressure used to justify repression
- Family succession planning

### C. The Pact-Making Tradition

Guillermo O'Donnell and other scholars noted that elite pacts could enable democratic transitions - but El Pacto shows how pacts can also enable authoritarian consolidation when designed to subvert rather than protect democratic institutions.[^55]

---

## XII. Comparison to Somoza Dynasty

| Feature | Somoza (1937-1979) | Ortega (2007-present) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Family control | Yes | Yes (co-presidency with wife) |
| Constitutional manipulation | Yes | Yes (indefinite reelection, co-presidency) |
| National Guard/Police | Personal instrument | Personal instrument |
| U.S. relations | Allied | Adversarial |
| Opposition treatment | Repression | Repression, exile, citizenship stripping |
| Civil society | Controlled | Destroyed |
| Duration | 42 years | 18+ years and counting |

> "Ortega first seized control after his Sandinista guerrillas ousted the Somoza family dynasty that had held power in Nicaragua from 1937 to 1979. Now, critics accuse him of authoritarianism, corruption and of again turning Nicaraguan politics into a family affair."[^56]

---

## Key Statistics Summary

| Metric | Figure | Source/Date |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Deaths (2018 uprising) | 355+ | IACHR |
| Political prisoners expelled (Feb 2023) | 222 | Amnesty International |
| Citizenship revocations (2023+) | 450+ | HRW 2024 |

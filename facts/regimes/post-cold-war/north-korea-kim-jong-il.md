# Kim Jong-il's North Korea (1994-2011)

## Overview

Kim Jong-il (1941-2011) was the second supreme leader of North Korea, ruling from his father Kim Il-sung's death in July 1994 until his own death in December 2011. His 17-year reign was marked by the devastating famine known as the "Arduous March," the development of North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the consolidation of the Songun (military-first) policy, and the maintenance of one of the world's most repressive political systems.

---

## Pre-Conditions: The Hereditary Succession

### Kim Il-sung's Death (July 8, 1994)

Shortly before noon on July 7, 1994, Kim Il-sung collapsed from a heart attack at his residence in Hyangsan, North Pyongan Province. Despite efforts by doctors flown in from Pyongyang, Kim Il-sung died at 02:00 am on July 8, 1994, at age 82. His son Kim Jong-il was announced as North Korea's next leader with the title "The Great Successor" that same day.[^1]

### Decades of Succession Preparation

The succession was carefully prepared over many years, making it unique among communist states:

- **1974**: North Korea entered a "duumvirate" period where father and son ruled together with shared power for 20 years[^2]
- **1980**: At the 6th Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) Congress, Kim Jong-il was elected as a Presidium member and formally chosen as successor, establishing the [[north-korea-kim-dynasty|Kim dynasty]][^3]
- **1991**: Kim Il-sung transferred chairmanship of the National Defense Commission to his son[^4]
- **1993**: Kim Jong-il assumed supreme commandership of the Korean People's Army[^4]

> "By the time that Kim Il Sung died in 1994, Kim Jong Il -- then in his early fifties -- had been helping to run the country for most of his adult life."[^5]

This hereditary succession was unprecedented in the communist world. As scholar Charles Armstrong noted: "Among communist states, which generally decried hereditary succession as 'feudal,' the Kim family's inter-generational power transfer was unique."[^5]

---

## Rise to Power (1994-1998)

### The Three-Year Mourning Period

Following Kim Il-sung's death, an official mourning period was implemented in accordance with Neo-Confucian tradition, as prescribed by Zhu Xi (1130-1200 AD), who stipulated that pious Confucians should spend three years mourning their parents.[^6]

During this mourning period:
- The positions of President and Party Chief were officially left vacant[^6]
- Kim Jong-il conducted virtually no public activity while consolidating power[^7]
- All songs, dances, games, and amusement were officially banned during the initial ten-day mourning period[^6]

### The "Eternal President" Designation

In a 1998 constitutional amendment, the presidency was written out of the constitution, and Kim Il-sung was posthumously named the country's "Eternal President" to honor his memory.[^8] This meant Kim Jong-il would never hold the title of President; instead, he was named:

- **October 1997**: Chairman of the Korean Workers' Party[^9]
- **September 1998**: Chairman of the National Defense Commission, redefined as the nation's highest post[^10]

---

## Methods of Control

### Songun (Military-First) Policy

Songun ("military-first") politics became the defining governance principle of Kim Jong-il's rule. Though the concept originated from a 1960 visit with his father to military headquarters, it did not appear as official government policy until after Kim Il-sung's death in 1994.[^11]

**Key aspects of Songun:**

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Origin** | August 25, 1960 visit to Seoul 105th Guards Armored Division (now a national holiday)[^12] |
| **Official adoption** | 1995, following Kim Jong-il's first visit to a military unit[^11] |
| **Core principle** | "A politics which solves all problems...on the principle of giving priority to the military affair"[^13] |
| **Institutional change** | 1998 constitutional amendments formalized the NDC as the supreme national decision-making body[^14] |

**Why Songun was adopted:**

The policy emerged from multiple crises in the early 1990s:
1. Collapse of the Soviet Union (1991) - ending aid and trade concessions
2. Death of Kim Il-sung (1994)
3. Natural disasters and economic crisis
4. Kim Jong-il's primary power base was military (he was second in command at his father's death)[^15]

The songun concept fundamentally replaced the proletariat and Communist Party with the army as the driving force in society.[^16] In 2019, Songun ideology was removed from the DPRK Constitution, though it was reaffirmed in 2022 following the collapse of the Hanoi Summit.[^17]

### The Songbun System

The songbun social classification system, developed between 1957-1960, continued under Kim Jong-il as a hereditary caste system dividing citizens into three classes:[^18]

| Class | Percentage | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Core (loyal)** | ~25% | Descendants of peasants, factory workers, anti-Japanese fighters, military officials |
| **Wavering** | ~55% | Average North Koreans, considered neutral |
| **Hostile** | ~20% | Former ministers, landowners, lawyers, merchants |

These three classes are further divided into 51 subcategories.[^19] Files are maintained on every North Korean from age 17 and updated every two years.[^20]

> Barbara Demick describes this as "an updating of the hereditary caste system, combining Confucianism and Stalinism."[^21]

**Impact on daily life**: Songbun determines access to food, housing, residential location, employment, and education.[^22] "Tainted blood" by law lasts for three generations.[^21]

**Famine-era changes**: As the centralized system collapsed during the famine, the importance of songbun decreased somewhat. Private enterprise allowed some lower-class North Koreans to buy privileges previously reserved for high songbun.[^23]

### Party Purges

Kim Jong-il maintained power through systematic purges of potential rivals:

**The Deepening Group Incident (1996-2000)**
- Kim Jong-il established a secret police organization called "Shimhwajo" within the Ministry of Social Security[^24]
- Led by Jang Sung-taek (later executed by Kim Jong-un in 2013)
- Approximately 25,000 people purged: ~10,000 executed, ~15,000 sent to concentration camps[^24]
- Senior officials were made scapegoats for the economic crisis and famine[^24]
- Notable victims: Seo Kwan-hee (agricultural secretary, executed by firing squad), Moon Seong-sik (party secretary, reportedly tortured to death)[^24]

**Purge of the Sixth Army Corps (1995)**
- More than 20 officers accused of attempting a coup were killed soon after Kim Jong-il took power[^25]

**2010 Purge**
- Kim Jong-il ordered the purge of 100 senior officials, killing dozens - the last great purge of his regime[^26]

---

## The Famine: "Arduous March" (1994-1998)

### Death Toll Estimates

The famine remains one of the deadliest in modern history. Out of a total population of approximately 22 million, estimates vary widely:[^27]

| Source | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| **Official DPRK** | 225,000-235,000 |
| **2001/2007 independent research** | 600,000-1,000,000 (3-5% of population) |
| **US Congressional staffers (1998)** | 900,000-2,400,000 |
| **Natsios estimate** | 2,500,000-3,500,000 |
| **US Census Bureau (2011)** | 500,000-600,000 excess deaths (1993-2000) |

Most scholars consider the most plausible estimates to fall in the range of 600,000 to 1 million deaths.[^28]

### Causes

**Economic factors:**
- Loss of Soviet support after 1991 dissolution[^29]
- By 1993, China supplied 77% of fuel imports and 68% of food imports, but then sharply cut aid due to its own grain shortfalls[^30]
- Collapse of the centrally planned distribution system

**Agricultural mismanagement:**
- Deforestation of hillsides to expand farmland, even in unsuitable steep areas[^31]
- Resulting erosion contributed to devastating floods

**Natural disasters:**
- 1995 floods: Over $15 billion in damage, 400,000+ hectares of farmland destroyed[^32]
- 1996 floods: Hit "breadbasket" regions producing 60%+ of national food supply[^32]
- 1997 drought[^33]

### International Response

- **1996**: United Nations sent emergency food aid[^34]
- **1997**: United States began shipping food aid
- **1999**: US shipments peaked at 700,000 tons[^35]
- **Total US contribution**: Close to 1.9 million tons of food according to 2003 Senate hearings[^36]

The term "Arduous March" (고난의 행군) became the official metaphor following a 1993 state propaganda campaign, referencing a fable about Kim Il-sung's anti-Japanese guerrilla fighters "fighting against thousands of enemies in 20 degrees below zero, braving a heavy snowfall and starvation."[^37]

---

## Nuclear Program Development

### The Agreed Framework (1994)

On October 21, 1994, just months after Kim Jong-il assumed power, the United States and North Korea signed the Agreed Framework:[^38]

- North Korea agreed to freeze operation and construction of nuclear reactors suspected of being part of a covert weapons program
- In exchange: Two proliferation-resistant light water reactor power plants
- US to supply fuel oil pending construction
- Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) formed to implement the agreement

### Collapse of the Framework

Implementation was troubled from the start:[^39]

- **October 2002**: Washington announced Pyongyang admitted to possessing a uranium-enrichment program
- **Response**: KEDO suspended oil shipments
- **January 10, 2003**: North Korea announced withdrawal from the NPT
- **May 31, 2006**: KEDO officially ended the light-water reactor project[^40]

### First Nuclear Test (October 9, 2006)

At 10:35 AM local time on October 9, 2006, seismic sensors detected an underground nuclear explosion near P'unggye-ri.[^41]

- Yield: Less than 1 kiloton (confirmed by analysis of air samples on October 16)[^42]
- North Korea became the world's ninth nuclear-armed state[^43]
- October 31, 2006: North Korea agreed to rejoin six-nation disarmament talks[^44]

> "The 2006 nuclear test would consolidate Kim Jong-il's leadership by demonstrating his commitment to national defense and his ability to achieve what his father had only dreamed of."[^45]

### Second Nuclear Test (May 25, 2009)

The second test was conducted on May 25, 2009:[^46]

- Magnitude 4.7 seismic event detected
- Estimated yield: 2-7 kilotons[^47]
- Pyongyang notified Washington and Beijing approximately one hour before detonation[^48]

**Political context**: The test was widely believed to be connected to succession planning following Kim Jong-il's 2008 stroke, demonstrating the regime's commitment to nuclear weapons even during potential weakness.[^49] UN Security Council passed Resolution 1874 condemning the test and tightening sanctions.[^50]

---

## Repression and Human Rights

### Prison Camp System (Kwan-li-so)

North Korea maintains a system of political penal labor camps (kwalliso) run by the State Security Department:[^51]

**Major camps identified:**
- Camp 14 (Gaecheon/Kaechon)
- Camp 15 (Yodok)
- Camp 16 (Hwaseong/Myeonggan) - largest at ~549 km2[^52]
- Camp 18 (Gaechon)
- Camp 25 (Chongjin)

**Prisoner population**: 80,000-120,000 in political penal-labor camps[^53]

**Key features:**
- **Guilt-by-association**: Up to three generations of a family may be imprisoned for one person's alleged political offenses[^54]
- **Total control zones**: No re-education; prisoners not expected to be released[^55]
- **Forced labor**: Mining (coal, gold, iron ore), tree felling, agriculture[^56]
- **Conditions**: Estimated 40% of inmates die from malnutrition; every former inmate interviewed by researchers witnessed at least one public execution[^57]

Prisoners were held on charges such as "opposing the succession of Kim Jong-il."[^58]

### Public Executions

Public executions resumed in October 2007 after declining in previous years amid international criticism.[^59]

- **2011**: Two people executed before 500 spectators for handling propaganda leaflets from South Korea, as part of ideological tightening during succession preparation[^60]
- **2004**: Kim Jong-il established organization for "Elimination of foreign capitalist ideology," cracking down on those consuming foreign media[^61]
- Executions reportedly conducted near rivers, fields, markets, schools, and sports grounds; family members including children forced to watch[^62]

### Human Rights Watch Assessment

> "Kim Jong-Il exercised total control for 17 years over one of the world's most closed and repressive governments. He was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands, and perhaps millions, of North Koreans through widespread preventable starvation, horrendous prisons and forced labor camps, and public executions."[^63]

Capital punishment is used for many offenses including theft, political dissent, defection, consumption of unapproved media, and proselytizing religious beliefs.[^64]

---

## The Personality Cult

### Origins and Development

Kim Jong-il was instrumental in creating his father's personality cult before developing his own. In 1967, he was appointed to the state propaganda and information department, where he developed the veneration of Kim Il-sung and the title "Great Leader" (위대한 수령) came into habitual usage.[^65]

### Kim Jong-il's Own Cult

Around 1980, Kim Jong-il assumed the title "Dear Leader" (친애하는 지도자), and the government began building a personality cult patterned after his father's.[^66]

**Official titles** (over 1,200 created according to state media):[^67]
- Dear Leader
- Great Comrade
- Supreme Commander
- Father
- The Eternal Sun
- The Guardian Deity of the Planet
- The Sun of the 21st Century
- The Sun of Socialism
- The Ever-Victorious General

### Mythological Claims

**Birth mythology:**
- Official version: Born February 16, 1942 at a secret guerrilla camp on Mount Paektu; a double rainbow appeared and a new star emerged in the heavens[^68]
- Actual: Born February 16, 1941 in the Soviet Union village of Vyatskoye; childhood name was Yura (Russian)[^69]

**Other propaganda claims:**
- Learned to walk at three weeks, talking at eight weeks[^70]
- Wrote 1,500 books over three years at Kim Il Sung University, plus six full operas "better than any in the history of music"[^70]
- Could "stop the rain and make the sun come out"[^71]

### Information Control

Kim Jong-il maintained strict censorship, following guidelines from his own book *The Great Teacher of Journalists* which instructs: "newspapers carry articles in which they unfailingly hold the president in high esteem, adore him and praise him."[^72]

**Media control:**
- All media outlets owned and controlled by the government[^73]
- All news content produced and censored by the Korean Central News Agency
- All journalists are Workers' Party members from "politically reliable families"[^73]
- Listening to foreign broadcasts is a severely punished crime[^74]
- Illegal to own radio/TV capable of tuning to non-official stations[^74]

> "Everything North Koreans received from the government -- clothes, rice, apartments -- were said to come directly from 'the Great Leader' or 'the Dear Leader.'"[^75]

---

## Inter-Korean Relations: The Sunshine Policy Era

### The 2000 Summit

The Sunshine Policy, created by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in 1998, led to the first-ever meeting between leaders of the two Koreas since the Korean War.[^76]

**June 13-15, 2000**: Kim Dae-jung flew to Pyongyang for the historic summit
- First use of the air route in 55 years[^77]
- Welcomed by 500,000 Pyongyang citizens[^78]
- June 15th North-South Joint Declaration adopted[^79]

**Declaration points:**
1. Independent reunification
2. Peaceful reunification promotion
3. Humanitarian issues (separated families)
4. Economic cooperation and exchange
5. North-South dialogue[^79]

**Recognition and controversy:**
- Kim Dae-jung awarded 2000 Nobel Peace Prize[^80]
- Later revealed that several hundred million dollars had been paid to North Korea ("cash-for-summit scandal")[^81]

### Inter-Korean Economic Projects

**Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC)**
- Launched 2004 in North Korea, just across the border[^82]
- Run by South Korean committee with 50-year lease; Hyundai Asan developed the land[^83]
- At peak (2015): 125 companies, 54,988 North Korean employees, production valued at $560+ million[^84]
- Closed February 2016 following DPRK rocket launch[^85]

**Mount Kumgang Tourism**
- Opened to foreign tourists in 1998[^86]
- Nearly 2 million tourists visited, mostly South Korean[^87]
- Suspended in 2008 after a South Korean tourist was shot by a North Korean guard[^88]

---

## 2008 Stroke and Succession Preparation

### The Health Crisis

In August 2008, Kim Jong-il suffered a debilitating stroke that placed him in a life-threatening situation.[^89]

**Details from French neurosurgeon Dr. Francois-Xavier Roux:**
- Flown urgently to Pyongyang in August 2008
- Found Kim unconscious in intensive care at Red Cross Hospital
- "He was in intensive care, in a coma, in a bad way... a life-threatening situation"[^90]

Kim's absence from the September 9, 2008 military parade celebrating North Korea's 60th anniversary confirmed international suspicions of serious illness.[^91] The regime kept the stroke secret for several weeks.[^92]

### Succession to Kim Jong-un

After recovery, Kim Jong-il began designating his third son [[north-korea-kim-jong-un|Kim Jong-un]] as heir apparent:[^93]

**Key succession moves:**
- **June 2009**: Announced Kim Jong-un as intended successor[^94]
- Despite never serving in the military, Kim Jong-un was made a four-star general[^95]
- Given leadership positions controlling military, government, and Workers' Party[^95]

Dr. Roux noted that during his 2008 visit, Kim Jong-un was "often at his father's bedside."[^96]

The May 2009 nuclear test was likely intended to demonstrate regime strength during a period of potential weakness and to establish North Korea as a nuclear power within Kim Jong-il's lifetime.[^97]

---

## Death and Legacy (December 17, 2011)

### Circumstances of Death

Kim Jong-il died on December 17, 2011, reportedly of a heart attack while traveling by train.[^98]

- Death announced December 19, 2011 by Korean Central Television
- Presenter Ri Chun-hee announced he died at 8:30 AM of "advanced acute myocardial infarction, complicated with a serious heart shock"[^99]
- Had received treatment for cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases[^100]

Kim Jong-un was immediately announced as "great successor to the revolutionary cause of Juche and outstanding leader of our party, army and people."[^101]

### Legacy Assessment

**Nuclear state foundation:**
- Conducted two nuclear tests (2006, 2009)
- Established North Korea as the world's ninth nuclear-armed state
- Within North Korea, credited with making the DPRK "strong and independent through the development of nuclear weapons"[^102]

**Economic legacy:**
- International assessments "generally negative, blaming him for the continued economic decline"[^103]
- Directed substantial budget to military and nuclear weapons while citizens suffered famine[^104]

**Personality cult continuation:**
- Declared "Eternal Chairman" of the National Defense Commission[^105]
- Referred to as "Eternal General Secretary" of the WPK[^105]

**Human rights legacy:**
> "Kim Jong-Il ruled through fear generated by systematic and pervasive human rights abuses including arbitrary executions, torture, forced labor and strict limits on freedom of speech and association."[^106]

---

## Scholarly Debates

### The Totalitarianism Question

Scholars debate how to characterize the North Korean political system:

**Classic totalitarianism view:**
- North Korea remains "the world's longest lasting totalitarian regime, having spanned some 4 decades and surviving generational leadership succession"[^107]
- The only totalitarian regime to weather a leadership transition (Kim Il-sung to Kim Jong-il)[^107]
- Totalitarian character maintained through institutional changes despite economic collapse[^108]

**Post-totalitarian/institutional pluralism view:**
- McEachern argues Kim Jong-il's government, while highly centralized, was "less centralized than his father's" and shows "institutional pluralism"[^109]
- Political institutions played an equally critical role alongside Kim's personal authority[^110]

**Cultural-historical explanation:**
- Some analysts argue North Korean totalitarianism's intensity stems from building a Stalinist one-party regime on "the historical legacy of the Sinocentric Confucian mandarinate"[^111]

**Digital totalitarianism evolution:**
- Recent scholarship examines how technological sophistication reshapes North Korea's approach to totalitarian governance through enhanced surveillance and ideological programming[^112]

### Famine Responsibility Debate

Scholars differ on attributing responsibility for the 1990s famine:

**Government responsibility arguments:**
- "The crisis was systemic, intimately related to the authoritarian structure of government and the absence of accountability to the citizenry"[^113]
- Claims that natural disasters caused the famine "were misleading... the decline in food production and deterioration in internal conditions were visible years before the floods of 1995"[^114]
- "With plausible policy adjustments -- the government could have avoided the famine"[^114]
- Evidence suggests international food aid was "improperly diverted... to black markets or to politically favored segments of the population"[^115]

**Nuanced perspectives:**
- Neither policy errors nor natural disasters suggest "a deliberate or desired outcome for the North Korean government"[^116]
- The tragedy was "not one of criminal negligence but rather of blind allegiance to the modernizing ideology of high-energy agriculture and the nationalist chimera of complete food self-sufficiency"[^117]
- Assessment: "This was bad policy. Considering that as much as 10% of the population died in the late 1990s, this was in fact atrocious policy."[^117]

**Structural factors emphasized:**
- State monopoly on food and discriminatory distribution to favored classes[^118]
- Centrally planned system proved "too inflexible to effectively curtail the disaster"[^119]

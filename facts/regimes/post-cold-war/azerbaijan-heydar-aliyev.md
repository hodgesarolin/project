# Heydar Aliyev's Regime in Azerbaijan (1993-2003)

## Overview

Heydar Alirza oghlu Aliyev (10 May 1923 - 12 December 2003) was an Azerbaijani politician who served as the third President of Azerbaijan from 1993 to 2003. A former KGB general and Soviet Politburo member, Aliyev represents a distinctive case of post-Soviet authoritarian consolidation, combining a classic Communist nomenklatura background with successful dynastic succession and petro-state development.

## 2. First Rise: Azerbaijan SSR First Secretary (1969-1982)

### Appointment and Brezhnev Connection
- Elected First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party on 12 July 1969
- Selected by Brezhnev after advocacy from Semyon Tsvigun (Brezhnev's brother-in-law)
- Rose through ranks due to close associations with Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov
- Appointed amid a Soviet anti-corruption campaign

### Leadership of Soviet Azerbaijan
- Governed Azerbaijan SSR for 13 years (1969-1982)
- Ran anti-corruption campaigns that made him "undisputed leader of Azerbaijan"
- Promoted individuals from his native Nakhchivan to leadership positions
- Oversaw industrial development and expansion of Baku metro system

> **ANALYSIS**: Aliyev's anti-corruption campaigns were notably selective - targeting those who refused cooperation while elevating loyalists. This pattern would repeat in his post-Soviet rule.

## 3. Moscow Career and Gorbachev-Era Fall (1982-1987)

### Rise to the Politburo
- Became candidate (non-voting) member of Soviet Politburo in 1976
- On 22 November 1982, promoted by Andropov to full Politburo member
- Appointed First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR
- Responsible for transportation and social services
- Attained the highest position ever reached by an Azerbaijani in the Soviet Union
- Rare honor for a non-Russian to reach full Politburo membership

### Dismissal by Gorbachev (October 1987)
- Dismissed from Politburo and First Deputy Premier position
- Official reason: health grounds
- Actual reasons: fallen out with Gorbachev over anti-corruption campaign and perestroika
- Part of Gorbachev's purge of "Brezhnevite old guard"
- Soviet media later attacked him for alleged corruption
- Alternative Azerbaijani narrative: resigned "as a sign of protest" against Gorbachev's policies

> **NOTE**: Competing narratives exist about whether Aliyev was fired or resigned. Western sources consistently describe forced removal; Azerbaijani state sources frame it as principled resignation.

## 5. The 1993 Return: Civil War and "Invitation" to Power

### Context: Elchibey Government Crisis
- Abulfaz Elchibey elected president in 1992 in generally free and fair vote
- Leader of nationalist Azerbaijan Popular Front
- Government faced military disasters in Nagorno-Karabakh War
- Internal conflicts with military commanders

### Suret Huseynov Rebellion
- Huseynov: former troop commander in Nagorno-Karabakh, dismissed by Elchibey
- After Armenian capture of Kalbajar (March 1993), tensions escalated
- Huseynov refused to disband militia in Ganja after being removed from government
- 4 June 1993: Elchibey's forces attempted to arrest Huseynov; operation failed catastrophically
- 69 casualties in confrontation
- Huseynov's militia, armed with Russian 104th Airborne Division materiel, began "march on Baku"

### Aliyev's Political Maneuvering
- Elchibey, facing strengthening opposition, turned to Aliyev for help
- Thomas Goltz (Azerbaijan-watcher) described this as "inviting a crocodile into the goat-pen"
- 15 June 1993: Aliyev elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet (Parliament Speaker)
- 18 June 1993: Elchibey fled to his home village in Nakhchivan
- 24 June 1993: Parliament granted Aliyev special powers in president's absence
- 25 June 1993: Huseynov appointed Prime Minister; situation stabilized

### The "Russia-Backed Coup" Question
- Sources describe the coup as "Russia-backed"
- Huseynov's forces armed with Russian military equipment
- Alternative view: organic domestic crisis that Aliyev exploited masterfully

### Path to Presidency
- August 1993: National referendum stripped Elchibey of presidency
- 3 October 1993: Aliyev elected president with 98.8% of vote
- First dynastic succession setup in post-Soviet space

## 6. First Nagorno-Karabakh War and 1994 Ceasefire

### The Conflict (1988-1994)
- Rooted in Soviet-era administrative decisions placing Armenian-majority Nagorno-Karabakh within Azerbaijan SSR
- Full-scale war erupted as Soviet Union collapsed
- By 1993, Armenia controlled Nagorno-Karabakh plus seven surrounding Azerbaijani districts
- Armenian forces occupied approximately 20% of Azerbaijan's geographic area

### Casualties and Displacement
| Category | Estimate |
|----------|----------|
| Total deaths | 28,000-38,000 |
| Azerbaijani military killed | 11,557 (official) / 25,000-30,000 (Western/Russian estimates) |
| Armenian military killed | 5,856-6,000 |
| Azerbaijani civilians displaced | ~724,000 |
| Armenian civilians displaced | 300,000-500,000 |

### Bishkek Protocol (12 May 1994)
- Provisional ceasefire signed in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan
- Signatories: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Republic of Artsakh, Russia
- Established "line of contact" separating forces
- Created a "frozen conflict" lasting until 2020

### Aliyev's Role
- Came to power promising to restore order and recapture lost regions
- Signed ceasefire recognizing military reality on ground
- Engaged in numerous summit meetings with Armenian leaders
- 1998: Met with Robert Kocharian in Washington (Goble Plan discussions)
- 2001: Met Kocharian in Key West, Florida - reportedly close to agreement
- Domestic opposition in both countries prevented final settlement

> **ANALYSIS**: The frozen conflict became a defining feature of Azerbaijani politics under both Aliyevs, used to justify continued military spending and nationalist mobilization while actual resolution remained elusive.

## 7. Methods of Control

### New Azerbaijan Party (YAP)

**Founding:**
- Founded 21 November 1992 in Nakhchivan
- Created after "appeal of 91 intellectuals" invited Aliyev to lead new party
- Inaugural constituent conference held in Nakhchivan (550-member initiative group traveled there)
- Aliyev elected chairman; Political Council formed

**Rise to Dominance:**
- Became ruling party after November 1995 parliamentary elections
- Won 62.3% of popular vote and 75/125 seats in 2000/2001 elections
- Has been predominant voice in Azerbaijani politics for three decades
- Membership confers advantages (preference for public positions)

Sources: [New Azerbaijan Party Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Azerbaijan_Party), [YAP Official](https://yap.org.az/en/view/pages/5/)

### Constitutional Manipulation

**1995 Constitutional Referendum:**
- Held 12 November 1995 alongside parliamentary elections
- Draft constitution prepared by commission headed by President Aliyev
- Result: 93% in favor, 86% turnout (official figures)
- Established separation of powers (Milli Majlis, President, courts)

**2002 Constitutional Referendum:**
- Held 24 August 2002
- Eight separate questions, all approved with at least 96% in favor
- Key changes:
  - Abolished proportional party-list elections to Parliament
  - Changed presidential line of succession from Parliament chairman to Prime Minister
  - Favored simple majority in presidential election calculations
- OSCE reported "ballot stuffing, overt police presence, pressure on voters, multiple voting"
- Widely seen as preparing ground for dynastic succession

### Opposition Suppression

**Barring Opposition Parties:**
- Five leading opposition parties and ~600 independent candidates barred from 1995 elections
- Popular Front and Musavat prohibited from contesting 1995 and 2000 parliamentary elections
- Prominent opposition figures repressed under both Heydar and Ilham Aliyev

**Semi-Authoritarian Framework:**
- Opposition parties allowed to exist but not effectively compete
- Popular Front lacked funds and business community support
- Aliyev "could not found an authoritarian regime even if he desired" due to civil society established under brief democratic period

## 9. Economic Stabilization

### The Crisis (1991-1995)
- GDP fell over 60% in first year of independence
- Cumulative GDP decline: ~61% between 1989 and 1995
- Hyperinflation peaked in early 1990s
- Consumer price index increased 1,664% year-on-year by 1994
- Causes: severed Soviet ties, Nagorno-Karabakh war, budget deficits financed by money printing

### Stabilization Under Aliyev
- 1995: Broader privatization program targeting 70% of state property
- Late 1990s: Budget deficit reduced to ~4% of GDP
- Inflation fell to single digits through monetary tightening
- State Oil Fund (SOFAZ) established 1999 to channel oil revenues
- Poverty rate: decreased from 68% (1995) to 29% (2005)

### Economic Transformation
- Two distinct periods:
  - 1991-1995: Economic chaos and regression
  - Post-1996: Macroeconomic stability and dynamic growth
- Oil production ramp-up in early 2000s: government expenditures rose 600% over eight years
- Oil income per capita roughly equaled Russia by 2006
- Oil exports: 74% of government revenue (2011), 95% of export earnings

Sources: [Economy of Azerbaijan Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Azerbaijan), [Azerbaijan.az Oil Strategy](https://azerbaijan.az/en/related-information/131)

### Corruption Networks

**Structure:**
- President's direct control of SOFAZ and opacity of SOCAR enabled patronage networks
- Vertically integrated "bribe-pooling system": bribes sent upward, portion redistributed as "envelope salaries"
- Horizontally integrated through massive holding companies
- Allegations of corruption date to original 1990s investment deals

**Aliyev's Approach:**
- Washington Post obituary: "He made a name for himself by smashing local mafia groups, but his personal circle moved in to profit off oil, caviar and other sectors"
- Selective anti-corruption: targeted non-cooperators, rewarded loyalists
- Former U.S. Ambassador Richard Kauzlarich (1994-1997): "Heydar Aliyev maintained very tight control of corruption... He certainly wasn't blatant about it"
- Sworn testimony from one investor: Aliyev "directed that we wire transfer sums of money into bank accounts held for the benefit of relatives"

> **ANALYSIS**: Unlike his son Ilham, Heydar Aliyev maintained more disciplined, centralized corruption - extracting rents while keeping the system functional. The more visible kleptocracy emerged under Ilham.

## 10. Repression: Political Prisoners, Media, Elections

### Political Prisoners
- Arrests for political reasons began after Aliyev came to power (1993)
- Peaked by end of 1990s: list included 716 names
- Compare: Gorbachev era (Vezirov-Mutalibov period) had fewer than 10 political prisoners
- Most released after Azerbaijan joined Council of Europe and made commitments
- 14 prisoners sentenced to life for political reasons remained; guilt "proven neither during investigation nor during trials"

Sources: [Human Rights House Foundation](https://humanrightshouse.org/interviews/the-most-important-thing-for-a-political-prisoner-is-to-know-they-are-remembered/), [Human Rights in Azerbaijan Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Azerbaijan)

### Media Harassment
- Persecution of dissidents, arrests of journalists became "reality of life"
- Criminal justice system used to silence political rivals and journalists criticizing corruption
- Independent media outlets shut down
- International monitors (Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International) banned from country

### Election Fraud

| Election | Result | Issues |
|----------|--------|--------|
| October 1993 | Aliyev: 98.8% | Amid civil war chaos |
| November 1995 | YAP majority | 5 opposition parties, 600 candidates barred |
| October 1998 | Aliyev: >70% | "Marred by irregularities" |
| November 2000 | YAP majority | OSCE: "crash course in methodologies of manipulation"; ballot box stuffing |
| October 2003 | Ilham: official winner | OSCE: "failed to meet OSCE commitments"; ballot-stuffing, pre-marked ballots, intimidation |

**OSCE Assessment of 2003 Election:**
- "Significant irregularities during voting and widespread fraudulent practices"
- Pre-marked ballots for Ilham Aliyev
- Multiple voting, voter intimidation
- Final vote tabulation kept from monitors
- Police arrested electoral commission members who refused to sign fraudulent paperwork

## 11. Dynastic Succession

### Grooming Ilham Aliyev

**Background:**
- Born 1961, son of Heydar Aliyev
- Integrated into YAP leadership and governing hierarchy
- Following "Yeltsin model" of succession (as Yeltsin did with Putin)

**Constitutional Preparation:**
- 2002 constitutional referendum changed succession: Prime Minister (not Parliament Speaker) next in line
- This enabled direct father-to-son transfer

**The Handover:**
- April 2003: Heydar Aliyev collapsed during public address, disappeared from public view
- 4 August 2003: Ilham appointed Prime Minister
- Shortly before October 2003 election: Heydar withdrew candidacy, endorsed Ilham
- 31 October 2003: Ilham became president after two-month term as PM
- First dynastic succession in post-Soviet state

**Assessment:**
> "In trying to ensure a dynastic political transition in Azerbaijan, President Heidar Aliyev was pursuing a variant of a succession model developed in Russia by former Russian leader Boris Yeltsin." - RFE/RL

> "Should Ilham Aliyev become president after his father's death, it would be the first dynastic succession in a post-Soviet state." - Carnegie Endowment

## Scholarly Debates

### The "Oil Curse" and Petro-Authoritarianism

**Michael Ross's Framework:**
Key work: *The Oil Curse* (Princeton University Press)

Core finding: "Countries rich in petroleum have less democracy, less economic stability, and more frequent civil wars than countries without oil."

Three mechanisms tested:
1. **Rentier Effect**: Resource-rich governments use low taxes and patronage to dampen democratic pressures
2. **Repression Effect**: Resource wealth enables strengthening of internal security forces
3. **Modernization Effect**: Oil-based growth fails to bring social/cultural changes that produce democracy

Ross found "at least limited support for all three effects."

Sources: [Princeton University Press](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691159638/the-oil-curse), [Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/abs/does-oil-hinder-democracy/67665D8D240C8F43CD4A2DCB35894071)

**Azerbaijan as Case Study:**
- Oil income per capita (1991-2006 mean): $370
- By 2006, oil income per capita roughly equaled Russia
- Oil provides 74% of government revenue, 95% of export earnings
- Government expenditures rose 600% over eight years after oil ramp-up

> "The post-independence trajectories of Azerbaijan and Georgia are consistent with the theory that oil wealth allowed Azerbaijan's post-Soviet elites to reconsolidate authoritarian rule, while Georgian elites, not similarly endowed with rents, lacked the economic resources to stave off democratization."

Sources: [ScienceDirect - Economics of Petro-Authoritarianism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301420723004634)

### Post-Soviet Comparative Authoritarianism

**Shared Patterns with Central Asian Leaders:**

| Leader | Country | Background | Succession |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| Heydar Aliyev | Azerbaijan | KGB chief, Politburo member | Dynastic (to son Ilham, 2003) |
| [[kazakhstan-nazarbayev\|Nursultan Nazarbayev]] | Kazakhstan | Communist First Secretary | Managed transition (2019) |
| Islam Karimov | Uzbekistan | Communist First Secretary | Died in office (2016), no succession plan |
| Saparmurat Niyazov | Turkmenistan | Communist First Secretary | Died in office (2006), no succession plan |

**Aliyev's Distinctive Features:**
- Most impressive Communist past (Politburo member)
- Only one to achieve successful dynastic succession during his lifetime
- Combined KGB background with oil wealth

**The "Yeltsin Model":**
- Aliyev followed variant of succession model developed by Yeltsin
- Integrated son into ruling party leadership and governing hierarchy
- Appointed son as Prime Minister to ensure automatic succession
- Difference from Yeltsin-Putin: family rather than protege succession

Sources: [Foreign Policy Centre](https://fpc.org.uk/passing-on-the-authoritarian-torch-power-transition-in-central-asia/), [Carnegie - Birth of Dynasty](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2003/08/birth-of-a-dynasty?lang=en&center=russia-eurasia)

### The Semi-Authoritarian Question

**Scholarly Debate:**
Some scholars argue Aliyev established a "semi-authoritarian" rather than fully authoritarian regime:
- Opposition parties allowed to exist (unlike classic totalitarianism)
- Civil society established during brief Elchibey period could not be fully dismantled
- Elections held regularly (though fraudulent)
- Some space for criticism (within limits)

**Counter-argument:**
- Opposition effectively unable to compete
- Media harassment and political prisoners
- Electoral fraud at every level
- Cult of personality and dynastic succession

> "Aliyev could not found an authoritarian regime even if he desired; instead, he chose to transit into a semi-democratic regime in which opposition parties including the PFA were allowed to compete."

vs.

> "His regime in Azerbaijan has been described as dictatorial, authoritarian, and repressive."

### Petroaggression and Conflict

Jeff Colgan's research (2021): "Petroaggression was the most common type of military conflict around the world - petrostates launch wars more often than other countries."

Both Russia and Azerbaijan classified as petrostates in this framework.

Relevance to Nagorno-Karabakh:
- Frozen conflict maintained under Heydar Aliyev
- Oil wealth enabled massive military buildup
- Second Nagorno-Karabakh War (2020) under Ilham demonstrated petro-funded military modernization

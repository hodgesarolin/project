## Classification

Trujillo's regime is classified as a **personalist military dictatorship** with totalitarian characteristics:

- **One-man rule**: All power concentrated in Trujillo personally, even when others held titular presidency
- **Military foundation**: Rose through U.S.-trained National Guard; maintained power through military control
- **Extreme cult of personality**: Required portraits in homes; renamed capital "Ciudad Trujillo"; slogans like "God in Heaven, Trujillo on Earth"
- **Secret police terror**: SIM employed surveillance, torture, and assassination domestically and internationally
- **Family-based kleptocracy**: Family controlled ~60% of national economy
- **Racial ideology**: State-sponsored anti-Haitianismo used to justify the 1937 genocide

The Trujillo dictatorship has been judged "more prominent and more brutal than its contemporaries" in the Caribbean Basin.

---

## Pre-Conditions

### U.S. Military Occupation (1916-1924)

The United States occupied the Dominican Republic from May 15, 1916 to September 18, 1924, establishing direct military governance.

**Reasons for occupation**:
- Concerns about German use of the Dominican Republic during WWI
- Pressure to force repayment of debts to European creditors
- Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine (1904) — U.S. as "international police power" in Western Hemisphere

**Critical legacy**:
- U.S. Marines created the **Dominican Constabulary Guard** (later National Guard/Police)
- This new professional military force replaced partisan militias
- Trujillo joined in 1918, trained by U.S. Marines
- Colonel Richard Malcolm Cutts personally trained Trujillo
- By 1924, Trujillo commanded the national army

**A State Department official later called Trujillo "a kind of Frankenstein, brought to life by the US Marines."**

### Political Instability

The post-occupation Dominican Republic suffered from:
- Weak democratic institutions
- History of caudillo-style politics
- Limited experience with representative government
- Economic dependence on sugar exports

### Hurricane San Zenon (September 3, 1930)

Just weeks after Trujillo's inauguration, a Category 4 hurricane devastated Santo Domingo:
- **Death toll**: 2,000-8,000
- **Damage**: Only 400 of 10,000 buildings left standing
- **Homelessness**: 50,000-100,000 people displaced
- **Estimated damage**: $40 million

**Trujillo's response** consolidated his power:
- Personally organized relief efforts
- Deployed entire military within 24 hours
- Used crisis to establish authoritarian control
- Rebuilt Santo Domingo according to his specifications (later renamed Ciudad Trujillo)

---

## Rise to Power

### Military Career (1918-1930)
- **1918**: Joined National Guard with help from employer and U.S. Major James J. MacLean
- **1919**: Received commission as second lieutenant; trained by U.S. Marines
- **1924**: Named commander of National Police when U.S. withdrew
- **1927**: Promoted to general
- **1928**: Named brigadier general by President Horacio Vasquez

### Seizure of Power (1930)

Trujillo orchestrated a coup against President Vasquez:
- Encouraged a rebellion led by Rafael Estrella Urena in Santiago
- Kept the military "neutral" (i.e., did not defend the president)
- Vasquez went into exile
- Trujillo eliminated political rivals through intimidation or force
- **Rigged presidential election (May 1930)**: Won unchallenged with 99% of the vote
- **August 16, 1930**: Inaugurated as president

Trujillo then militarized the police force, transforming it into a personal army under his exclusive control.

### Maintenance of Power

Though Trujillo occasionally stepped aside from the presidency (installing his brother Hector or puppet presidents), he retained absolute control for 31 years through:
- Command of the military
- Placement of family members in key positions
- Murder of political opponents
- Economic monopolization
- Pervasive secret police surveillance

---

## Methods of Control

### Secret Police: SIM (Servicio de Inteligencia Militar)

The SIM was the primary instrument of state terror in the later Trujillo era.

**Structure**:
- Created ~1957, replacing Department of State for Security
- Directed by Johnny Abbes Garcia from 1958-1961
- Employed thousands of operatives
- Controlled immigration, passports, censorship, supervision of foreigners

**Operations**:
- Operatives known as "calies" (thugs) patrolled streets in black VW Beetles ("cepillos")
- At the Palace of Communications, ~50 people intercepted domestic and foreign phone conversations
- Relied heavily on informants throughout society

**Detention and Torture Centers**:
- **La Nueve** ("The Nine") — Infamous torture facility
- **La Cuarenta** ("The Forty") — Primary torture and execution site

**Torture methods**:
- Beatings with blunt objects
- Waterboarding (simulated drowning)
- Electric shocks to sensitive body parts, including slow electrocution
- Sleep deprivation and prolonged isolation
- Sexual violence
- Psychological coercion through threats to family members
- Victims' screams broadcast over PA systems to terrorize other prisoners

**Disposal of victims**:
- Bodies reportedly fed to sharks
- Remains incinerated at San Isidro airbase
- Families often denied remains

**International Operations**:
- 1956: Kidnapping of Jesus de Galindez from New York City
- 1960: Attempted assassination of Venezuelan President Romulo Betancourt (car bomb in Caracas)
- Murder of Spanish writer Jose Almoina in Mexico

SIM was dissolved in 1962 after the regime's fall.

### Cult of Personality

Trujillo created one of history's most extreme personality cults.

**Titles**:
- "El Jefe" (The Boss/Chief)
- "El Benefactor de la Patria" (Benefactor of the Fatherland)
- "Padre de la Patria Nueva" (Father of the New Fatherland)
- "Generalissimo" (self-promoted in 1934)

**Mandatory Displays**:
- Every home required to display Trujillo's portrait
- Placards on doors stating "Trujillo es el jefe aqui" (Trujillo is the boss here) — homes without them deemed suspect
- Electric sign in capital: "Dios y Trujillo" (God and Trujillo)
- Churches required to post: "Dios en el cielo, Trujillo en la tierra" (God in Heaven, Trujillo on Earth)
- Eventually the order was reversed: "Trujillo on Earth, God in Heaven"

**Renaming Campaign**:
- **1936**: Santo Domingo renamed "Ciudad Trujillo"
- San Cristobal province renamed "Trujillo"
- Pico Duarte (highest peak) renamed "Pico Trujillo"
- Countless streets, bridges, parks, and buildings named for him
- Statues mass-produced and erected across the country

**Pervasive Imagery**:
- License plates included "Viva Trujillo!" and "Ano del Benefactor de la Patria"
- Newspapers required daily front-page praise
- Every public event paid homage to the dictator
- Portraits, statues, and the hymn to "Ilustre Hermano Benefactor" (Illustrious Brother Benefactor) omnipresent

**Indoctrination**:
- Schoolchildren taught to revere Trujillo
- No aspect of life escaped regime intervention — laws regulated underwear, hairstyles, broadcasting, theater, and movies

Bernard Diederich wrote: "The cult of adulation had no limits. The capital city bore Trujillo's name, as did the highest mountain peak and hundreds of streets, parks and sites. The tropical landscape was literally dotted with his likeness."

### Censorship and Media Control

- All newspapers censored; anti-regime publications shut down
- Required daily front-page praise of Trujillo
- SIM supervised all broadcasting, theater, and films
- Foreign communications monitored

### Political Repression

- Opposition parties banned or suppressed
- Political opponents murdered, imprisoned, or exiled
- Civil liberties nonexistent
- "Culture of fear" maintained through unpredictable violence

## Key Events & Atrocities

### The Parsley Massacre (El Corte) — October 1937

The Parsley Massacre was a state-sponsored genocide targeting Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent.

**Timeline**:
- **October 2, 1937**: Trujillo delivered speech in Dajabon falsely claiming Haitians were attacking farmers and stealing cattle
- **Late September - October 1937**: Systematic killing campaign across border regions

**The "Parsley Test"**:
Soldiers identified suspected Haitians by asking them to pronounce "perejil" (parsley). Those who could not properly trill the "r" in Spanish — due to Haitian Creole or French pronunciation — were killed.

**Death Toll Estimates** (heavily disputed):
- **Low estimates**: 9,000-12,000
- **Mid-range scholarly consensus**: 15,000-20,000
- **High estimates**: 30,000-35,000
- Joaquin Balaguer claimed 17,000 in his memoirs
- Historian Frank Moya Pons: ~18,000
- Mass graves were never found, complicating verification

**Methods**:
- Primarily machetes, bayonets, and clubs to avoid evidence of government involvement
- Some shooting
- Killings concentrated in border areas but occurred nationwide

**Aftermath**:
- U.S. under FDR's "Good Neighbor Policy" pushed for compensation rather than justice
- Trujillo agreed to pay Haiti $525,000 (~$30 per victim)
- No high-ranking Dominican official ever prosecuted

**Historical Significance**:
- Arguably the largest mass murder of people of African descent in the 20th-century Americas
- Anti-Haitianismo became fully institutionalized as pillar of Dominican national identity
- Reinforced through state propaganda, education, and border policy

### Murder of the Mirabal Sisters (November 25, 1960)

**Background**:
- Patria, Minerva, and Maria Teresa Mirabal opposed the Trujillo regime
- Used codename "Las Mariposas" (The Butterflies)
- Minerva was first woman to graduate from Dominican law school; banned from practicing
- Sisters helped found the 14th of June Revolutionary Movement (1J4)
- Their husbands were imprisoned as political dissidents

**November 2, 1960**: Trujillo publicly stated he had only "two problems left: the Catholic Church and the Mirabal sisters."

**The Murder (November 25, 1960)**:
- Sisters and driver Rufino de la Cruz were traveling to visit imprisoned husbands
- SIM agents stopped their car on an isolated mountain road
- Driver killed first
- Sisters kidnapped, strangled, and beaten to death with clubs
- Bodies placed back in car, pushed over cliff to simulate accident

**Legacy**:
- According to Bernard Diederich: "Had greater effect on Dominicans than most of Trujillo's other crimes"
- Paved way for Trujillo's assassination six months later
- November 25 designated by UN as International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women (1999)
- Faces appear on Dominican currency
- Julia Alvarez's novel *In the Time of the Butterflies* (1994) brought global attention

### Kidnapping of Jesus de Galindez (March 12, 1956)

**Background**:
- Basque Spanish exile who fled to Dominican Republic in 1939
- Investigated Trujillo regime while living there
- Fled to New York City in 1946
- Became Columbia University professor of international law
- Wrote doctoral dissertation critical of Trujillo — his thesis advisor said he "knew more about the regime than anybody else"

**Motive**:
- Trujillo agents offered $25,000 for the manuscript; Galindez refused
- Dissertation to be presented on February 27, 1956 (Dominican Independence Day) — Trujillo considered this a "supreme personal insult"

**The Kidnapping (March 12, 1956)**:
- Galindez last seen entering subway at 57th Street and 8th Avenue, Manhattan
- Abducted, forced into ambulance, drugged
- Flown from Long Island to West Palm Beach to Dominican Republic
- Never seen again

**Cover-up**:
- Six additional people killed over nine months to conceal the crime
- Pilot, copilot, nurse, two airport employees, Dominican colonel
- American pilot Gerald Murphy found hanged in his cell (January 1957) — FBI declared suicide note a forgery

**Impact**:
- Front-page news in New York; damaged Trujillo's international standing
- Case never officially solved
- Described as "the beginning of the end" for Trujillo
- Columbia awarded Galindez his PhD in absentia (June 1956)

### Assassination Attempt on Venezuelan President (1960)

- SIM orchestrated car bombing against President Romulo Betancourt in Caracas
- Bomb killed driver and bystander; Betancourt survived with burns
- Led to OAS sanctions against Dominican Republic
- Contributed to U.S. withdrawal of support for Trujillo

---

## Economic Policies

### Monopolization and Kleptocracy

Trujillo created a predatory economic system centered on family enrichment.

**Industries Controlled**:
- Sugar (dominant export; Trujillo bought out much of the industry)
- Tobacco
- Salt
- Lumber
- Cattle/meat and milk
- Insurance
- Lottery
- Beer
- Matches
- Cigarettes
- Peanut oil

**Scope of Control**:
- Trujillo family eventually controlled **~60% of the national economy**
- Acquired ~one-third of cultivated land
- Standard 10% kickback on all public works contracts
- Multiple palaces and ranches (12 personally owned)
- **Personal wealth at death (1961)**: Estimated $800 million

### Infrastructure Development

Despite corruption, the regime did oversee modernization:
- Road construction
- Hospitals and schools
- Sanitation improvements
- Post-hurricane reconstruction (1930)
- Paris-style avenues in rebuilt capital

**However**: Benefits disproportionately flowed to Trujillo family, supporters, and military personnel.

### Debt Manipulation

In a series of complicated transactions, Trujillo:
- Cancelled internal public debt
- Bailed out his own sugar interests using government funds
- Propaganda lauded these moves, but they actually:
  - Doubled the Republic's financial liabilities
  - Inflated credit structure
  - Undermined banking stability

### Economic Legacy

Trujillo left the Dominican Republic with:
- Dualist economy
- Predominantly poor working and peasant class
- Small elite class
- Worsening socioeconomic conditions for most Dominicans

---

## Fall / End

### Growing International Isolation (1959-1961)

**Castro's rise changes U.S. calculus**:
- After Cuban Revolution (1959), U.S. feared Caribbean instability
- Trujillo's brutality became liability rather than asset

**Key turning points**:
- Murder of Mirabal sisters (November 1960) — galvanized opposition
- Failed assassination of Venezuelan president (June 1960)
- OAS condemned Dominican Republic and imposed sanctions
- U.S. broke diplomatic relations

### The Assassination (May 30, 1961)

**Conspirators**:
- Group of seven dissidents including military officers and civilians
- Led by General Antonio Imbert Barrera and General Juan Tomas Diaz
- Key shooter: Antonio de la Maza

**CIA Involvement**:
- 1973 CIA Inspector General investigation found "quite extensive Agency involvement with the plotters"
- March 31, 1961: Three .30-caliber M1 carbines supplied to dissidents from U.S. embassy
- April 19, 1961: Four M3 machine guns and 240 rounds sent via diplomatic pouch
- February 1961: Secretary of State Dean Rusk informed President Kennedy of assassination plots
- CIA maintained officially it had "no active part" and only "faint connection"
- Kennedy, after Bay of Pigs fiasco (April 17, 1961), ordered plans canceled — but conspirators proceeded independently

**The Ambush**:
- Trujillo's blue 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air ambushed on road outside Santo Domingo
- Trujillo attempted to fight back but was shot multiple times
- Died at the scene

**Immediate Aftermath**:
- Ramfis Trujillo returned from Paris to take control
- SIM hunted down conspirators
- Hundreds detained and tortured
- "Hacienda Maria Massacre" (November 18, 1961): Six conspirators executed
- Only Imbert and Luis Amiama Tio survived; evacuated by CIA

---

## Aftermath

### Transition Period (1961-1962)

**Initial chaos**:
- Ramfis Trujillo attempted to maintain family control
- Executed most of his father's assassins

**November 1961**: Military "Rebellion of the Pilots" forced Trujillo family into exile (fled to France)

**Joaquin Balaguer transition**:
- Former puppet president assumed effective power
- Forced by U.S. to share power with Council of State (January 1, 1962)
- Introduced reforms to open up regime

**Attorney General report (April 1962)**:
- After Trujillo family fled, documented that in previous five years alone, regime responsible for 5,700 known murders or disappearances

### Brief Democratic Experiment (1962-1963)

**December 1962 elections**: Juan Bosch won — scholar and poet who had founded Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) in exile

**February 27, 1963**: Bosch inaugurated as first democratically elected post-Trujillo president

**September 25, 1963**: Military coup after just seven months
- Generals accused Bosch of communist sympathies
- Business elite opposed social reforms
- Donald Reid Cabral installed as president

### Dominican Civil War (April-September 1965)

**Cause**: Bosch supporters (Constitutionalists) attempted to restore him to power

**U.S. Intervention (April 28, 1965)**:
- President Lyndon Johnson authorized deployment of 42,000 U.S. troops
- Justified by alleged communist involvement
- Operation Power Pack
- OAS later joined intervention

**Outcome**:
- Ceasefire August 31, 1965
- Provisional government established
- U.S. intervention aided anti-Bosch forces

### Balaguer Era (1966-1996)

**July 1966 elections**: Joaquin Balaguer defeated Bosch with open U.S. support

**Balaguer's rule**:
- 22 years as president (1966-1978, 1986-1996)
- Described as "benign imitation" of Trujillo-style caudillo politics
- Used military and police to suppress political opposition
- Repression of free speech and human rights abuses
- Strengthened oligarchy; intensified poverty
- Continued anti-Haitian policies

**Legacy**: The civil war and intervention deepened divisions, delayed democratic governance, and set stage for decades of authoritarian tendencies.

## Scholarly Debate

### Traditional View: Brutal Caudillo

Early scholarship portrayed Trujillo as archetypal Latin American military strongman — ruthless, arrogant, violent. This view emphasized:
- Personal brutality and corruption
- Terror as primary mechanism of control
- Totalitarian repression

### Revisionist Scholarship: Social Foundations of Despotism

**Richard Lee Turits, *Foundations of Despotism* (2003)**:
- Challenges simplistic demonization
- Argues regime survived not just through terror but through **popular support among peasants**
- Agrarian policies provided peasants free access to land during economic growth
- Regime mediated social and economic transformations
- Created "participatory state" that regulated nearly all aspects of Dominican life
- Described as "powerful critique of the simplistic demonizing of the Caribbean dictatorial model"

### Cultural Studies Approach

**Lauren Derby, *The Dictator's Seduction* (2009)**:
- Goes beyond analysis of military force
- Examines how Trujillo controlled everyday life
- Analyzes cultural instruments: music, art, religion, poetry
- Shows how Trujillo built "symbolic legitimacy" and "political consensus"
- Explains absolute control through cultural rather than purely coercive mechanisms

### Death Toll Debates

**Parsley Massacre numbers remain contested**:
- Range from ~9,000 to 35,000
- Mass graves never found
- Scholars generally cite 15,000-20,000 as reasonable estimate
- Some argue lower figures minimize genocide; others argue higher figures lack documentation

### Anti-Haitianismo Interpretations

**Debate**: Was the Parsley Massacre primarily about:
- Racial "whitening" (blanqueamiento)?
- Border security and nationalism?
- Economic competition over land and labor?
- All of the above?

**Consensus**: Trujillo institutionalized pre-existing anti-Haitian sentiments into systematic state ideology that persisted long after his death.

### U.S. Responsibility

**Key question**: What responsibility does the U.S. bear for:
- Creating the National Guard that enabled Trujillo's rise?
- Supporting or tolerating the regime for decades?
- The 1961 assassination?

## Comparisons

### Trujillo vs. Duvalier (Haiti)

Both dictators ruled neighboring countries on Hispaniola with similar methods but different outcomes.

| Aspect | Trujillo (DR) | Duvalier (Haiti) |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Dates** | 1930-1961 | 1957-1971 (Papa Doc); 1971-1986 (Baby Doc) |
| **Death Toll** | ~50,000 total | ~30,000+ |
| **Secret Police** | SIM | Tontons Macoutes |
| **Ideology** | Anti-Haitianismo, Hispanic/Catholic identity | Black nationalism, Vodou manipulation |
| **Economic Legacy** | Built infrastructure, trade links; left dualist economy | Raided treasury; economic devastation |
| **U.S. Relations** | Cold War ally until late 1950s | Tolerated as anti-communist |
| **End** | CIA-backed assassination | Baby Doc exiled 1986 |

**Connection**: Johnny Abbes Garcia, Trujillo's SIM director, later worked as security advisor for Papa Doc Duvalier in Haiti (1966-1967).

**Key difference**: Trujillo sought riches through trade and monopolies; the Duvaliers simply looted the treasury. The Dominican Republic retained economic foundations for later development; Haiti did not.

### Regional Context

Trujillo's dictatorship overlapped with authoritarians across the Caribbean Basin:
- Batista in Cuba
- Somoza in Nicaragua
- Various military regimes in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras
- Perez Jimenez in Venezuela

Trujillo maintained a "network of complicity" with these regimes and with Francisco Franco of Spain.

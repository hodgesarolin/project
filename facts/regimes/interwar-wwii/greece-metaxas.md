## Overview

The **4th of August Regime** (Greek: Καθεστώς της 4ης Αυγούστου) was an authoritarian dictatorship that ruled the [[Kingdom of Greece]] from August 4, 1936, until the [[German Invasion of Greece|German invasion]] in April 1941. Led by General **Ioannis Metaxas** (1871-1941), the regime combined elements of [[Fascism|fascist]] aesthetics with traditional Greek conservatism, monarchism, and virulent [[Anti-Communism|anti-communism]].

The regime's ideology, known as [[Metaxism]], promoted a vision of national regeneration through the creation of a "Third Hellenic Civilization" that would synthesize ancient Greek and Byzantine values. While borrowing fascist organizational methods and symbols, historians generally classify the regime as a conservative authoritarian dictatorship rather than fully fascist, comparable to [[Francoist Spain]] or [[Salazar's Portugal]].

## 1. Rise to Power

### Background: Political Crisis of the 1930s

Greece in the mid-1930s faced severe political instability:

- **Economic crisis**: The [[Great Depression]] devastated Greece's export-dependent economy. Unemployment soared, exports collapsed, and agrarian unrest spread among tobacco farmers and workers.
- **Political deadlock**: The January 1936 elections produced no clear majority. The [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE) won 15 seats, becoming an unlikely kingmaker between 143 Monarchists and 142 Liberals/Republicans.
- **Institutional weakness**: The restored monarchy under [[King George II]] (returned 1935) faced a parliament incapable of forming stable governments.

### Metaxas's Path to Power

**Early career**: Metaxas (born April 12, 1871, in Ithaca) was a career military officer who rose through the ranks during the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912-1913), becoming Chief of Staff in 1913. A staunch monarchist, he opposed [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]'s pro-Allied policies in WWI and was exiled in 1917 when King Constantine I was deposed.

**Political marginalization**: After returning from exile in 1920, Metaxas founded the small Freethinkers' Party but achieved minimal electoral success. In the 1936 elections, his party won only 4% of the vote and 7 deputies.

**Appointment as Prime Minister**: Despite his lack of popular mandate:
- March 1936: King George II appointed Metaxas as Minister of War
- April 13, 1936: Following the death of Prime Minister Constantine Demertzis, the king appointed Metaxas as Prime Minister

### The August 4th Coup

On **August 4, 1936**, citing the threat of a general strike scheduled for the following day and communist agitation, Metaxas executed a self-coup with royal backing:

1. Declared a **state of emergency**
2. **Dissolved parliament** indefinitely
3. **Suspended constitutional articles** guaranteeing civil liberties
4. Decreed **martial law**

> "The dictatorship was the result of a long period of political instability, the tendency of the political establishment to accept authoritarian solutions, and a reaction to the emergence of a militant labor movement."

## 2. The "4th of August Regime" - Ideology and Structure

### Metaxism: Core Ideological Elements

The regime's official ideology, [[Metaxism]], incorporated:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Greek nationalism** | Promotion of cultural purity and a regenerated "Hellenic" identity |
| **Monarchism** | The crown as a pillar of national unity |
| **Anti-communism** | The regime's primary ideological enemy and raison d'etre |
| **Anti-parliamentarianism** | Rejection of liberal democracy as corrupt and divisive |
| **Corporatism** | State-supervised labor associations (though incompletely implemented) |
| **Clericalism** | Greek Orthodox Church as integral to national identity |
| **Anti-individualism** | Subordination of individual interests to the nation |

### Regime Structure

**Leadership cult**: Like [[Hitler]] with "Führer" and [[Mussolini]] with "Duce," Metaxas adopted the title **Archigos** (Greek: Leader/Chieftain). Propaganda portrayed him as:
- "The First Peasant"
- "The First Worker"
- "The National Father" of the Greeks

**No mass party**: Unlike Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy, Metaxas banned ALL political parties, including his own Freethinkers' Party. The regime derived authority from:
- The King
- The military officer corps
- The security apparatus

**Institutional framework**:
- Executive power concentrated in Metaxas as Prime Minister
- Legislative power exercised through emergency decrees (Emergency Laws)
- Judicial system retained but subordinated to security interests

### Debate: Fascism or Authoritarian Conservatism?

Historians remain divided on classification:

**Arguments for fascism/para-fascism**:
- Roman salute adopted
- Youth organization (EON) modeled on [[Hitler Youth]] and [[Balilla]]
- "Third Hellenic Civilization" echoes "Third Reich" and "Third Rome" palingenetic narratives
- Totalitarian aspirations in cultural policy

**Arguments against full fascism**:
- No mass political party
- No racial doctrine or antisemitism (considered "distasteful")
- No expansionist war aims
- Strong support for traditional institutions (Orthodox Church, monarchy)
- More reactive than revolutionary ideology

> "The Metaxas regime sought to comprehensively change Greece... In each of these policy areas, the Metaxas government seemed more nearly an anticipation of Francoist Spain than to resemble its contemporaries Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy."

---

## 3. Methods of Control

### The Asfaleia (Security Police)

The political police force, **Asfaleia**, became the regime's primary instrument of repression:

- **Leadership**: Headed by [[Konstantinos Maniadakis]], who maintained close ties with [[Heinrich Himmler]] on methods and techniques
- **Expansion**: Staff increased from 190 to 445 officers, with approximately 1,200 agents
- **Network**: Extensive informant network throughout Athens and Greece
- **Model**: Based upon the [[Gestapo]] structure and methods

> "In November 1936, on the initiative of the Gestapo, and as the result of an inquiry from the German legation in Athens, Metaxas declared that he approved the Greek Security Police and the Gestapo joining to exchange information as a 'defence against Bolshevik agitation.'"

### Maniadakis's Anti-Communist Methods

Konstantinos Maniadakis, called "the Greek Himmler," developed innovative suppression techniques:

1. **Fake Communist Party**: Created a regime-controlled fake "Communist Party" and published a counterfeit version of [[Rizospastis]] (the KKE newspaper)
2. **Mass arrests**: Imprisoned hundreds of KKE members
3. **Declaration of Repentance** (Dilosi Metanias): Political prisoners could gain release by publicly renouncing communist beliefs
4. **Loyalty certificates**: Required for public sector employment
5. **Informant networks**: Penetrated opposition organizations

**Effectiveness**: According to a German assessment, within a year of the regime's establishment, "communism lost its most important stronghold in the Near East." By 1940, the KKE had been virtually eradicated, with half of its approximately 2,000 remaining members in prison or exile.

### Censorship

**Ministry of Press and Tourism**: Created August 26, 1936 (Emergency Law 45/1936), headed by **Theologos Nicoloudis**

**Scope of control**:
- Press: Opposition journalists imprisoned or exiled; only favorable newspapers permitted
- Radio: Established YRE (today [[ERT]]), Greece's first state radio station, for propaganda purposes
- Theater: Completely subordinated to regime policy
- Cinema: All films subject to censorship
- Music: [[Rebetiko]] music banned; traditional Greek folk music promoted

**Censorship Committee** (Epitropi Logokrisias): Ensured all mass communication served as propaganda instruments.

### Book Burning and Banning

**Mass book burnings**: August 16, 1936
- Athens: In front of the Temple of Olympian Zeus and at the Propylaea
- Piraeus: At Pasalimani (Bay of Zea)
- Thessaloniki: Next to the White Tower (largest event)

**Over 445 book titles banned**, including works by:

| Foreign Authors | Greek Authors | Subjects |
|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Karl Marx | Stratis Myrivilis | Marxist theory |
| Sigmund Freud | Andreas Karkavitsas | Darwinian evolution |
| Leo Tolstoy | Alexandros Papadiamantis | Psychoanalysis |
| Fyodor Dostoevsky | | Democratic philosophy |
| Immanuel Kant | | |
| Maxim Gorky | | |
| George Bernard Shaw | | |
| Heinrich Heine | | |
| Stefan Zweig | | |
| Anatole France | | |
| Charles Darwin | | |
| Goethe | | |

**Classical works banned**: Even ancient Greek texts were censored, including:
- [[Thucydides]]'s "Funeral Oration of Pericles" (defense of democracy)
- [[Sophocles]]'s "Antigone"
- [[Plato]]'s "Republic"

### Propaganda Apparatus

The regime promoted a comprehensive cult of personality:

- **Charismatic leadership themes** in all media
- Promotion of values: "Country, Loyalty, Family and Religion"
- Emphasis on solidarity, love of country
- Projection of the ideal relationship between Metaxas and the monarchy

---

## 4. Economic Policies

### Corporatist Ambitions vs. Reality

**Stated goal**: Replace capitalism with a corporatist economic system promoting "national and social solidarity"

**Limited implementation**:
- King George II opposed corporatist representation, leading to postponement
- State-supervised labor associations: 1,257 by 1940
- Compulsory collective bargaining agreements: 823 ratified by 1939
- Corporatism served socio-political rather than truly economic interests

> "For all its solemn proclamations that Greece would be organized as a corporatist state, the Fourth of August regime under General Ioannis Metaxas did not break with past economic thought and policies."

### Labor Reforms

Despite banning strikes, the regime implemented significant worker protections:

| Reform | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **8-hour workday** | Standard working hours established |
| **5-day workweek** | Weekend rest mandated |
| **Paid holidays** | Two weeks vacation with pay, or double pay in lieu |
| **Minimum wage** | First national minimum wage |
| **Maternity leave** | Legal protections for mothers |
| **Unemployment insurance** | Through OAED (Employment Office) |
| **Child labor ban** | Prohibition with childcare centers established |
| **Work safety standards** | Stricter regulations enforced |
| **Union contracts** | Collective bargaining institutionalized |
| **Employer firing restrictions** | New limits on dismissals |

**Social Insurance Fund (IKA)**: Established 1934, but made operational nationwide by 1938 under Metaxas. Covered sickness, maternity, old-age, invalidity, and death.

### Agricultural Policy

**Goals**: Reduce food import dependency and support rural population

**Measures**:
- Price support for wheat through KEPES (Central Committee for the Protection of Domestic Wheat Production)
- Moratorium on agricultural debts
- Ministry of Cooperatives established 1938
- Import substitution policies

**Results**:
- Wheat production: 531,000 tonnes (1936) to 983,000 tonnes (1938)
- By 1939: Greece produced 60% of domestic wheat consumption needs

### Modernization Program

**Ten-year development program** launched April 1937:
- Land drainage projects
- Railway construction
- Road improvements
- Telecommunications infrastructure updates
- Public works initiatives

### Economic Outcomes

**Positive indicators (1936-1938)**:
- Unemployment: Reduced from 128,000 (1936) to 26,000 (1938) to 15,000 (1939)
- Per capita income increased
- Exports rose 57% in 1938
- Merchant shipping: 1.87 million tons (9th largest commercial maritime power)

**Limitations**:
- Recovery partly due to global economic improvement
- Unemployment rose after 1938
- Import substitution created conflicts with merchant class
- Preferential treatment of industry over commerce

---

## 5. Treatment of Opposition

### Political Prisoners

**Estimates vary significantly**:
- 15,000-30,000 arrested and jailed or exiled for political reasons
- Approximately 1,000 sentenced specifically to internal exile
- By October 1940, half of KKE's ~2,000 remaining members were imprisoned or exiled

**Targets**:
- Communists (primary target)
- Socialists
- Trade union organizers
- Liberal/Venizelist politicians
- Republican activists
- Journalists

**Treatment**:
- Torture used to extract confessions (described as "horrifying" by visitors like Arthur Koestler)
- Forced "Declarations of Repentance" (Dilosi Metanias)
- Most prisoners were working-class; some intellectuals

### Internal Exile System

**Island prison camps**: Prisoners sent to barren islands where they had to organize their own food and shelter:

| Island | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [[Akronauplia]] | Major prison for communists |
| Corfu | Held KKE General Secretary [[Nikos Zachariadis]] |
| Santorini | Exile location for political dissidents |
| Zante | |
| Kythera | |
| Icaria | |
| Makronisos | Later notorious during Civil War |
| Gyaros | |
| Agios Efstratios | |

### Notable Cases

**[[George Papandreou]]** (later Prime Minister): Exiled to Andros island

**Liberal politicians**: "Bourgeois political leaders who protested against the dictatorship were arrested and banished"

### Death Penalty and Political Violence

**Important distinction**: Unlike Nazi Germany or Stalin's USSR:
- No systematic political murders documented
- Death penalty NOT instituted for political offenses
- Regime relied on imprisonment, exile, and forced renunciation

> "While Metaxas' regime did play up the communist threat in order to justify its repression, the regime is not known to have committed political murders."

### Fate of Prisoners Under Occupation

Following the [[German Invasion of Greece]] (April 1941):
- Communist prisoners transferred to German control
- Many moved to [[Haidari Concentration Camp]] after Italian surrender (1943)
- 200 former Akronauplia inmates executed by Nazis at Kaisariani on May 1, 1944

---

## 6. Cultural Policies

### The "Third Hellenic Civilization"

**Concept**: Metaxas's regime would lay foundations for a glorious "Third Hellenic Civilization" combining:

| Civilization | Elements |
|--------------|----------|
| **First** (Ancient Greece) | Militarist values of [[Sparta]] and [[Ancient Macedonia]]; pagan virtues |
| **Second** (Byzantine Empire) | Orthodox Christian ethics; imperial glory |
| **Third** (To emerge) | Synthesis creating a culturally purified, regenerated Greek nation |

**Key distinction from fascist models**:
- Unlike the "Third Reich" or "Third Rome," no military-imperialistic intent
- Cultural/spiritual rather than territorial expansion
- Rejection of the [[Megali Idea]] (Greater Greece irredentism) as geographical concept
- The 1922 [[Asia Minor Catastrophe]] proved territorial expansion failed; cultural greatness would succeed

**Implementation**: Metaxas viewed this as a generational project, with the EON youth organization preparing future Greeks to realize this civilization.

### National Youth Organization (EON)

**Full name**: Ethniki Organosis Neolaias (Εθνική Οργάνωσις Νεολαίας)

**Established**: October 1936

**Models**: [[Hitler Youth]] (Germany), [[Balilla]] (Italy)

**Membership evolution**:
- 1938: 200,000 members
- Peak: Over 1,250,000 members
- 1939: Membership became **mandatory**
- Absorbed [[Boy Scouts of Greece]]

**Exclusions**: Only Christians could enroll; Jews and Muslims barred from membership

**Age structure**:
| Division | Ages | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| Children's | 8-12 | Basic education, physical fitness, introductory patriotic lessons |
| Adolescents' | 13-18 | Advanced physical training, history, cultural education |
| Young Adults' | 19-25 | Leadership preparation, active nationalist participation |

**Activities**:
- Athletic events and gymnastics (modeled on ancient Greek ideals)
- Parades and marches
- Military training
- Reforestation and recycling projects
- Summer camps combining physical training, ideology, and camaraderie
- Publications: magazines, pamphlets, books
- **Book burning**: EON members participated in public book burnings

**Oath**: Members swore fidelity to:
- The monarchy
- National pride and Greek civilization
- Opposition to parliamentarianism and communism
- Development of egalitarian, non-individualistic, virtuous citizens

**Slogan**: "One Nation, One Youth, One Leader"

### Cultural Promotion of Sparta

The regime emphasized "Spartan" values:
- Self-discipline
- Militarism
- Collective sacrifice
- Physical fitness
- Obedience

> "The traditional Greek values of 'Country, Loyalty, Family and Religion,' which Metaxas praised repeatedly, were also close to those of the ancient Spartans."

### Music and Arts Policy

**Rebetiko music**: Banned or heavily restricted
- Hashish dens banned
- Bouzouki and baglamas banned (or restricted to non-Eastern playing styles)
- Seen as degenerate music of urban underclass and Asia Minor refugees

**Promoted**: Traditional Greek folk music

**Theater**: Completely subordinated to regime propaganda

---

## 7. Treatment of Minorities

### Slavic-Speaking Macedonians

The regime's **harshest minority policy** targeted Slavic speakers in northern Greece:

**Legal framework**:
- Order 122770 (1936): "On the restoration of the uniform language" - banned Macedonian Slavic in public and private
- Legal Act 2366 (September 7, 1938): Banned Slavic language even in domestic sphere
- Legal Act on "Activities against State Security" (December 18, 1936): Punished claims of minority rights

**Enforcement**:
- Over 5,000 Macedonians convicted and imprisoned for speaking their language
- Punishments: beatings, fines, imprisonment, forced castor oil consumption
- "Language oaths" administered in villages: forced renunciation of "Slavic dialect"
- Slavic inscriptions in churches plastered over
- Village names changed to Greek
- Special security units raided villages, burned Slavic books
- Macedonian teachers arrested
- Children punished for speaking Macedonian in schools
- Thousands sent to internal exile or expelled from Greece

**Emigration**: Conditions became "unbearable," prompting mass emigration to United States, Canada, and Australia

**Important caveat**: Despite severe persecution, no mass killings were planned or executed

### Greek Jews

**Paradoxically better treatment** than under previous governments:

**Improvements**:
- Anti-Semitic laws of previous governments repealed
- Law enacted prohibiting "incitement of citizens... to mutual contempt and hate"
- Ended anti-Semitic propaganda by Venizelists and [[EEE Party]]
- Press censorship prohibited antisemitic articles
- No antisemitic legislation enacted

**Context**: Prior to Metaxas:
- [[Campbell Pogrom]] in Thessaloniki (1931)
- EEE Party conducted violent attacks on Jews
- Jews used as "football" between political parties

**Limitations**:
- Jews excluded from EON (Christians-only organization)
- Jews not considered part of the Greek "ethnos" (defined as Greek-speaking Orthodox Christians)
- Binary paradigm: included as citizens, excluded from national identity unless converted

**Tragic aftermath**: 85% of Greece's Jewish population killed during [[Holocaust in Greece|Axis occupation]] - one of the highest percentages in Europe

---

## 8. Foreign Policy and World War II

### The Pursuit of Armed Neutrality

**Strategic position**: Metaxas recognized Greece's vulnerability but hoped to avoid war:

> "Metaxas was worried that the participation of Greece in such a war would lead to great destruction and hardship for the country and also threaten the sustainability of his regime, which lacked any popular legitimacy."

**The British connection**:
- Despite appearances of neutrality, Greece remained a close British ally
- Foreign policy largely determined by King George II's British ties
- 1936: Metaxas declared Greece would align with Britain in case of war
- 1938: After Munich Agreement, Metaxas sought formal alliance with Britain
- April 1939: Britain and France guaranteed Greek sovereignty after Italian occupation of [[Albania]]

**Relations with Axis powers**:
- Maintained significant trade relations with Germany
- Hoped ideological affinity with Germany/Italy would protect Greece
- Avoided formal alliance commitments with Britain to not provoke Axis
- Asfaleia cooperation with Gestapo on anti-communist matters

### Italian Provocations

Throughout 1940, Italy escalated tensions:
- August 15, 1940: Greek light cruiser [[Elli]] sunk by Italian submarine (while in port for a religious festival)
- Various border incidents from Italian-occupied Albania

### The Ultimatum and "OXI" (October 28, 1940)

**3:00 AM, October 28, 1940**: Italian Ambassador Emanuele Grazzi presented an ultimatum at Metaxas's home in Kifissia:
- Demand: Allow Axis forces to occupy unspecified "strategic locations"
- Deadline: 3 hours

**Metaxas's response**: "Alors, c'est la guerre" (French: "Then it is war")

**Popular legend**: Metaxas simply said "Oxi" (No) - this became the symbol of Greek resistance

> "In this, he echoed the will of the Greek people to resist, a will that was popularly expressed in one word: 'ochi' (Όχι)."

**Date symbolism**: Mussolini chose October 28 deliberately - the anniversary of his 1922 "March on Rome"

### The Greco-Italian War

**Italian invasion**: 5:30 AM, October 28, 1940 (before ultimatum expired)
- Six Italian divisions poured through Albanian border
- Aimed to conquer Greece quickly before winter

**Greek defense strategy**:
- Forward defensive deployments in Epirus
- Partial mobilization (250,000 troops by October 1940)
- Reliance on Pindus Mountains as natural barriers
- No preemptive strikes

**Italian failure**:
- [[Battle of Elaia-Kalamas]]: Italian offensive halted at defensive line
- [[Battle of the Pindus]]: Decisive Greek victory
- By November 13: Italians pushed back to original October 28 positions

**Greek counteroffensive** (November 1940 - January 1941):
- November 22: Korçë captured
- November 30: Pogradec captured
- December 6: Sarandë captured
- December 8: Gjirokastër captured
- December 24: Greeks controlled most of Northern Epirus
- January 1941: [[Capture of Klisura Pass]]

**Strategic significance**:
- 27 Italian divisions pinned by 16 Greek divisions
- Italians pushed 30 miles back into Albania
- **First Allied victory of World War II**
- Major Italian counterattack (March 1941) failed

**Stalemate**: By early 1941:
- Greeks advanced ~25km into Albania but could not deliver decisive blow
- Frostbite and ammunition shortages halted progress
- Troops needed for Bulgarian border as German threat grew

### Metaxas's Death and Aftermath

**January 29, 1941**: Metaxas died at 5:30 AM at his home in Kifissia

**Cause of death**: Officially septicemia from streptococcus infection (pharyngeal phlegmon leading to toxemia)

**Conspiracy theories**: Some theories suggest murder, but mainstream historians accept natural causes

**Successor**: [[Alexandros Koryzis]] (who committed suicide April 18, 1941, as Germans approached Athens)

### German Invasion and Fall of Greece

**April 6, 1941**: [[Operation Marita]] - German invasion of Greece
- [[Metaxas Line]] fortifications held by only one-third authorized strength (troops tied down in Albania)
- Combined Greek and British forces overwhelmed

**Collapse**:
- April 20, 1941: Greece surrendered to Germany
- April 23, 1941: Surrender to Italy

---

## 9. Death Toll and Human Rights Assessment

### Political Repression Statistics

| Category | Estimate |
|----------|----------|
| Arrested/jailed/exiled | 15,000-30,000 |
| Internal exile specifically | ~1,000 |
| Macedonians convicted for language violations | 5,000+ |
| Political murders | None documented |

### Nature of Repression

**Systematic but not murderous**:
- Torture used, but regime "relatively benign" compared to Nazi Germany
- No death penalty for political offenses
- Closer to Italian or Portuguese models than German model
- Emphasis on imprisonment, exile, and forced renunciation rather than execution

**Arthur Koestler's testimony** (1938 visit): Met secretly with underground opposition, hearing "horrifying stories of police brutality, especially the case of unspeakable torture inflicted on a young girl who was a communist"

### Assessment

The Metaxas regime was authoritarian and repressive, but not genocidal:
- Imprisoned and tortured political opponents
- Destroyed the Communist Party as an organization
- Severely persecuted linguistic minorities
- Banned strikes and free press
- However: no mass killings, no racial persecution, no concentration camps for extermination

---

## 10. Legacy and Historical Assessment

### Controversial Memory

Metaxas remains a deeply divisive figure in Greek historical memory:

**Positive assessments emphasize**:
- Rejection of Italian ultimatum ("OXI")
- Successful defense against Italian invasion
- Labor reforms and social insurance
- Kept Greece out of Axis alliance
- National unity during wartime
- Economic improvements (reduced unemployment)

**Negative assessments emphasize**:
- Authoritarian suppression of democracy
- Torture of political prisoners
- Persecution of minorities
- Destruction of civil liberties
- Press censorship and book burning
- Youth indoctrination
- Paved way for post-war authoritarianism

### Historical Classification

Historians generally classify the regime as:

| Classification | Proponents | Reasoning |
|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Conservative authoritarian dictatorship | Stanley G. Payne, others | No mass party, no racial doctrine, traditional institutions supported |
| Greek variation of fascism | Some historians | Fascist aesthetics, youth organization, "Third Civilization" concept |
| Para-fascist regime | Middle position | Strong fascist component without full ideological fascism |

> "Historians often place the 4th of August regime closer to other conservative authoritarian governments of the time, like Franco's Spain or Salazar's Portugal. It was anti-communist, nationalist, and paternalistic."

### OXI Day

October 28 is celebrated as a national holiday in Greece and Cyprus:
- "OXI Day" (No Day) commemorates Metaxas's rejection of the Italian ultimatum
- Irony: A dictator is celebrated for an act of democratic defiance
- The day honors Greek resistance more than Metaxas himself

### Post-War Political Influence

Metaxism has influenced:
- [[4th of August Party]] (post-war)
- [[Golden Dawn]] (far-right party, now banned)
- [[ELAM]] (Cyprus)

> "Today the only party of the Greek parliament which claims to follow the ideas of Metaxas is the right-wing extremist Golden Dawn."

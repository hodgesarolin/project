## Pre-Conditions

### The Russian Revolution (1917)
- **February Revolution**: Russians rioted over food shortages in St. Petersburg; Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in March, ending 300 years of Romanov rule
- **October Revolution**: Bolsheviks seized power under Lenin's leadership with the slogan "peace, land, and bread"

### Russian Civil War (1918-1922)
- War between "Red" Bolsheviks and "White" counter-revolutionary forces
- **War Communism** implemented: expropriation of private business, nationalization of industry, forced requisition of grain from peasants
- Devastation across the country, millions died

### New Economic Policy (NEP) (1921-1928)
- Introduced by Lenin in March 1921 as a "temporary expedient" following:
  - Russian famine of 1921 (millions starved)
  - Kronstadt rebellion of soldiers and sailors (March 1921)
  - Urban discontent with Bolshevik policies
- Lenin characterized it as "a free market and capitalism, both subject to state control"
- Abolished forced grain requisitions; replaced with tax in kind
- Allowed small-scale private enterprises
- **Success**: By 1928, agricultural and industrial production restored to 1913 pre-war levels

### Lenin's Death (January 1924)

## Rise to Power

### The General Secretary Position
- Appointed General Secretary on April 3, 1922
- Position appeared "mainly administrative" but gave control over appointments
- Built network of loyal supporters throughout party apparatus
- By early 1924, Stalin "seemed most unlikely to rise to the top"

### Stage 1 (1924-1925): Alliance Against Trotsky
- Formed "triumvirate" with Zinoviev and Kamenev to isolate Trotsky
- Supported NEP against Trotsky's rapid industrialization
- October 1924: Proposed "Socialism in One Country" theory
- 1925: Trotsky lost position as Commissar for War

### Stage 2 (1925-1927): Breaking the Triumvirate
- April 1925: Zinoviev and Kamenev found themselves in minority at Party Conference

- Summer 1926: Kamenev and Zinoviev formed "United Opposition" with Trotsky
- 1927: Kamenev and Zinoviev expelled from party
- January 1928: Trotsky exiled to Alma-Ata

## Methods of Control

### Secret Police Apparatus

**Evolution of Organizations**:
- **Cheka** (1917-1922): Created by Lenin on December 20, 1917
- **GPU** (1922): Department of NKVD
- **OGPU** (1923-1934): Joint State Political Directorate
- **NKVD** (1934-1946): Unified interior ministry and secret police

**Methods Used**:
- Vast network of informants in factories, offices, Red Army
- Extrajudicial NKVD troikas ("triplets") for sentencing
- "Physical means of persuasion" (torture) sanctioned by state decree
- Anonymous tip-offs considered sufficient for arrest
- Article 58 of Penal Code: vague "anti-Soviet activity" charges

### The Gulag System
- First established by Soviet decree of April 15, 1919
- Formally organized as Gulag in 1930 under OGPU control
- **Population growth**: ~100,000 in late 1920s to ~5,000,000 by 1936
- 18 million people passed through system (1930-1953)
- **Death toll**: 1.2-1.7 million died in the camps

### Propaganda and Cult of Personality

**Stalin's Cult**:
- Began with his 50th birthday party (December 1929)
- By 1933, twice as many pictures of Stalin in Moscow than of Lenin
- Portrayed as "Father of Nations," brilliant, kind, all-knowing
- All forms of media controlled: schools, art, newspapers, movies, books, posters, music

**Socialist Realism**:
- Only officially permitted art form
- Glorified Soviet workers and leaders
- Experimentation condemned as "bourgeois"

**Historical Manipulation**:
- Photographs altered: undesirable figures deleted, people inserted into scenes
- Stalin's role in 1917 Revolution "heavily exaggerated"
- Enemies simply removed from all photos

### Show Trials (Moscow Trials 1936-1938)
1. **First Trial (August 1936)**: 16 defendants including Zinoviev and Kamenev; all executed
2. **Second Trial (January 1937)**: 17 defendants including Radek and Piatakov; 13 shot, rest died in camps
3. **Third Trial (March 1938)**: 21 defendants including Bukharin and Rykov; tortured into confessions

## Key Events & Atrocities

### Collectivization (1928-1933)

**Goals**:
- Erase capitalism introduced under NEP
- Transform USSR into industrialized socialist state
- Ensure food supply for cities and export

**Implementation**:
- 1928: Only ~1% of farmland collectivized
- December 27, 1929: Stalin called to "liquidate the kulaks as a class"
- By 1932: 61.5% of households collectivized
- By 1940: 97% collectivized

**Resistance and Consequences**:
- Peasants slaughtered livestock rather than surrender it
- Animal population collapsed:
  - Horses: 34 million → 16 million
  - Cattle: 68.3 million → 38.6 million
  - Sheep/goats: 147.2 million → 50.6 million
  - Pigs: 20.9 million → 12.2 million

### Dekulakization

**Campaign Details**:
- Targeted "kulaks" (loosely defined as wealthy/exploitative peasants)
- Definition was "arbitrary and elastic"
- 2.1-2.3 million deported to remote regions (1930-1933)
- 20,000-30,000 executed by extrajudicial troikas
- ~1 million kulak households (5 million people) deported

**Death Toll**: 530,000-600,000 (excluding subsequent famine)

### Ukrainian Holodomor (1932-1933)

**Causes**:
- Result of forced collectivization launched 1929
- Requisition quotas set "impossibly high"
- Brigades ransacked homes for food
- Peasants forbidden to leave Ukraine to find food
- Aid not provided in sufficient quantities
- 1932 harvest was below average but "more than sufficient to sustain the population"

**Death Toll Estimates**:
| Source | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| 2003 UN statement (25 countries) | 7-10 million |
| Recent scholarship | 3.5-5 million |
| Most detailed demographic studies | 3.9 million |
| Conquest (1986) | 7 million total famine deaths |
| Davies & Wheatcroft (2009) | 5.5-6.5 million |

**Genocide Recognition**:
- Raphael Lemkin called it "the classic example of Soviet genocide"
- European Parliament recognized as crime against humanity (2008)
- European Parliament recognized as genocide (December 2022)

### The Great Purge (1936-1938)

**Triggered by**: Assassination of Sergei Kirov (December 1934)

**Who Was Targeted**:
- ~70% of Communist Party Central Committee executed or died in camps
- ~50% of Party Congress
- 81 of 103 highest-ranking military leaders executed
- 35,000 Red Army officers tried
- 80% of colonels, 90% of generals, all deputy commissioners of war

**Death Toll Estimates**:
- Official Soviet records: 681,692 executions in 1937-1938 alone
- Most scholars: At least 750,000 executed
- Total including camp deaths: 700,000-1,750,000

**End**: NKVD head Yezhov arrested and executed in 1938

### WWII Leadership (1941-1945)

**Initial Failures**:
- Stalin refused to believe Hitler would invade despite warnings
- Forbade defensive preparations
- Soviets "caught completely unprepared" by Operation Barbarossa (June 22, 1941)

**Recovery and Leadership**:
- Made himself Marshal of Soviet Union, Supreme Commander
- Formed GOKO and Stavka to centralize decision-making
- Sacked incompetent generals
- Accepted military advice from Zhukov and others
- Order 227 (1942): Forbade giving ground to Germans
- Appealed to nationalism and Russian Orthodox Church

**Key Victory**: Battle of Stalingrad (1942-1943) — bloodiest battle in history

**Human Cost**: ~27 million Soviet deaths (highest of any nation in WWII)

## Scholarly Debate

### Death Toll Estimates: Why Such Wide Ranges?
- Reliability of Soviet records
- Whether to include famine deaths
- Whether famines were intentional or byproduct of policy
- How to count indirect deaths vs. direct executions
- Access to archives only after 1991

**Key Question**: Stephen Wheatcroft argues ~1 million deaths were "purposive" while rest happened through "neglect and irresponsibility"

### Continuity vs. Discontinuity: Was Stalin a Continuation of Lenin?

**Continuity Argument**:
- Richard Pipes: Soviet Russia 1917-1924 was "as totalitarian" as under Stalin
- Stalinism was "prefigured by Lenin's ideology"
- Pipes: Stalin "faithfully implemented Lenin's domestic and foreign policy programs"
- Stephen Kotkin: Stalin's "violence was not the product of his subconscious but of the Bolshevik engagement with Marxist-Leninist ideology"

**Discontinuity Argument**:
- Stephen Cohen: Stalin "broke free from the ideology of Marx and Lenin"
- Robert Service: Lenin "laid foundations for a Stalin... but passage from Leninism to worse terrors of Stalinism was not smooth and inevitable"

### Totalitarian vs. Revisionist Interpretations

**Totalitarian Model (1950s-1960s)**:
- Hannah Arendt, Carl Friedrich, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Leonard Schapiro
- Marxist ideology led "inexorably" to hierarchical, centralized, violent rule
- Stalin's USSR grouped with Hitler's Germany

**Revisionist School (1960s onward)**:
- J. Arch Getty, Sheila Fitzpatrick
- Emphasized social history rather than top-down control
- Saw continuity as "modernization" rather than "totalitarianism"

### Role of Ideology vs. Personal Paranoia

**Ideology-Centered**: Violence was product of Marxist-Leninist engagement

**Paranoia-Centered**: Robert W. Thurston argues terror was "tragic result of mass anxiety and paranoia" affecting "everyone from Stalin to millions of ordinary citizens"

## Pre-Conditions

### The "Mutilated Victory" (Vittoria Mutilata)
- Despite winning WWI, Italy felt cheated at Versailles
- Promised territories in Dalmatia and Africa went to other powers
- Poet Gabriele D'Annunzio coined the phrase and led seizure of Fiume (1919)
- D'Annunzio used black-shirted paramilitaries and title "Il Duce" — later adopted by Mussolini

### Economic Crisis
- War cost Italy equivalent of $12 billion (1914 dollars)
- Massive inflation — lira fell to one-sixth of prewar value
- Demobilized soldiers returned to soaring unemployment

### The Biennio Rosso (Red Biennium, 1919-1920)
- "Two Red Years" of mass factory occupations and workers' councils
- September 1920: ~400,000 workers seized control of factories including Fiat in Turin
- Strikes, land-squatting, violence pushed Italy toward perceived anarchy

### Fear of Communist Revolution
- Conservative industrialists, landowners, middle class felt endangered
- Elite feared Italy would follow USSR
- Turned to Mussolini as only leader able to restore order

### Weak Liberal Governments
- Italy was only WWI victor unable to consolidate its political system
- Liberal elites refused to ally with Socialist or Popular parties
- Internal divisions paved way for radical nationalism

---

## Rise to Power

### Mussolini's Background
- Originally a socialist journalist and politician
- Expelled from Socialist Party for supporting WWI intervention
- Founded *Il Popolo d'Italia* newspaper
- At 39, became youngest Italian prime minister

### Fascist Party Formation (March 23, 1919)
- ~100 veterans, former socialists, and journalists met in Milan's Piazza San Sepolcro
- Formed Fasci Italiani di Combattimento (Italian Combat Squads)
- By summer 1922: 300,000 members, controlled several municipalities

### Blackshirts (Squadristi) Violence
- From fall 1920, began strike-breaking and dismantling labor unions
- Often supported by police or industrialists
- Used violence and intimidation to suppress opposition

### The March on Rome (October 27-30, 1922)
- October 24, 1922: Mussolini declared before 60,000 militants: "Our program is simple: we want to rule Italy"
- Fewer than 30,000 men actually marched
- Fascist squads seized train stations, post offices, telegraph lines
- **Key fact**: Mussolini stayed safely in Milan; arrived by train after the outcome was clear
- About a dozen people actually died (fascists later claimed 3,000 to mythologize "struggle")

### King's Decision
- Prime Minister Facta tried to declare martial law
- King Victor Emmanuel III **refused to sign**, fearing civil war
- October 30, 1922: King appointed Mussolini as Prime Minister
- Transfer was legal under Italian Constitution

### The Acerbo Law and 1924 Elections
- 1922: Fascists had only 35 deputies — weak position
- **Acerbo Law** (November 1923): Party with 25%+ of votes gets two-thirds of seats
- April 6, 1924: Using intimidation, National List won ~37% but received two-thirds of seats
- Last competitive election until 1946

  - Introduced death penalty for political crimes
  - Established firm press censorship
- November 1926: Special Court (Tribunale Speciale) for "enemies of the state"

## Methods of Control

### OVRA (Secret Police)

- ~50,000 agents infiltrated most aspects of life
- Methods: Informers, wiretaps, mail interception, arrests without warrants
- Political prisoners sent to **confino** (internal exile) on remote islands
- Major duty: Spying on Pope Pius XI — Church never fully controlled

### Press Censorship and Propaganda
- Books, newspapers, radio screened by fascist censors
- Opposition press suppressed

- Regime claimed propaganda purpose was to "tell the truth about Fascism"

### Cult of "Il Duce"

### Corporatism (Economic Control)
- "Third way" — neither capitalism nor communism
- Independent trade unions banned, replaced by Fascist-controlled syndicates
- Corporate State created employer-employee bodies for each sector

- Anti-intellectual pedagogy exalting physical exercise
- Goal: Forming "italiano nuovo" (new Italian)
- **Balilla Creed** (echoing Nicene Creed): "I believe in Rome the eternal... I believe in the genius of Mussolini..."
- Became model for Nazi Germany's youth organizations

## Scholarly Debate

### Was Italian Fascism Totalitarian or Authoritarian?

**Totalitarian view** (Emilio Gentile):
- Fascism was first totalitarian experiment in history
- "Sacralization of politics" through totalitarian methods
- Fascists themselves embraced "totalitarian" as positive description

**Authoritarian view** (Hannah Arendt):
- Classed Italian fascism as ordinary authoritarian ideology
- Only Stalinism and Nazism were true totalitarianisms

**Descriptive terms used**: "Imperfect totalitarianism," "incomplete totalitarian state," "totalitarian-oriented"

**Key point**: Fascist Italy retained facades — Grand Council active, King could dismiss Mussolini. Unable to achieve envisioned totalitarian system due to compromises with conservative/liberal elements.

### Mussolini's Influence on Hitler
- Hitler first sought out Mussolini; March on Rome was model
- Italian fascism was "elder brother" of Nazism
- Early photos show awkward Hitler beside confident Mussolini
- After Anschluss (1938), Germany became dominant partner
- Historian Goeschel: History has underrepresented Mussolini's influence on Germany

### Italian Resistance to Holocaust

**Traditional narrative**:
- ~85% of Italian Jews survived (third-highest after Denmark, Bulgaria)
- Consensus that Italian persecution was mild

**Revisionist scholarship** (Simon Levis Sullam):
- Half of Italian Jews murdered were arrested by Italians, not Germans
- Many arrests only possible due to civilian tip-offs
- Italy ignored its "era of the executioner"

**Statistics**:
- ~44,500 Jews in Italy; 7,680 murdered
- 694 Italians recognized as Righteous Among the Nations
- 2,000-3,000 Jews participated in resistance

### Consent vs. Coercion Debate

**De Felice's thesis**: Regime enjoyed broadest "consenso" (consent) 1929-1934, even during Depression

**Cold War era view**: Dictatorships ruled with iron fist; population terrorized or mesmerized

**Recent scholarship**: Neither consent nor coercion alone explains 20 years of rule; examines how fascist ideas permeated everyday life through both coercion and "more insidious means"

## Comparisons
- [[germany-hitler]] — relationship: causal (Mussolini influenced Hitler's early tactics); thematic (fascist ideology)
- [[spain-franco]] — relationship: temporal (Spanish Civil War intervention)

## Overview

Admiral Miklos Horthy de Nagybanya (18 June 1868 - 9 February 1957) served as Regent of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] from 1920 to 1944, presiding over one of the most consequential and controversial periods in Hungarian history. His regime represented a unique form of authoritarian conservatism - a "kingdom without a king" that navigated between democracy and dictatorship, ultimately becoming an [[Axis Powers|Axis ally]] and participant in the [[Holocaust]].

---

## 1. Rise to Power (1919-1920)

### Post-WWI Chaos

The collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918 plunged Hungary into unprecedented turmoil:

- **October 1918**: [[Mihaly Karolyi]] established a democratic republic
- **March 21, 1919**: Communists under [[Bela Kun]] seized power, establishing the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]
- **133 days of Communist rule**: The "Red Terror" intimidated or murdered enemies of the regime
- **August 1, 1919**: Romanian forces entered Budapest; Kun's regime collapsed

### Formation of the Counter-Revolution

On May 30, 1919, anti-communist politicians formed a counter-revolutionary government in the French-occupied city of Szeged. Horthy, a former Austro-Hungarian naval commander still considered a war hero, was appointed:
- Minister of War in the counter-government
- Commander of the newly formed [[National Army]]

### The White Terror (1919-1921)

Horthy transferred his headquarters to western Hungary where his officers' detachments instituted a reign of terror:

**Key perpetrators:**
- [[Pal Pronay]]
- [[Gyula Ostenburg-Moravek]]
- [[Ivan Hejjas]]

**Victims:**
- Communists and social democrats
- Suspected supporters of the Soviet Republic
- Jews (broadly blamed for the revolution)
- Peasants and political liberals

**Death toll estimates:**
- Low estimate: 1,500 (historian Krisztian Ungvary)
- High estimate: 5,000 (historian Zsuzsa L. Nagy)
- Imprisoned: 60,000-75,000

> [!note] Horthy's Role
> Horthy issued no written orders for extralegal killings but provided explicit or implied consent. He called the perpetrators "my best men" and tacitly supported the right-wing officer detachments.

### Entry into Budapest

On **November 16, 1919**, Horthy marched into Budapest riding a white horse - deliberately invoking a thousand years of Hungarian equestrian warrior imagery going back to [[Arpad]].

### Election as Regent

On **March 1, 1920**, the National Assembly elected Horthy as Regent of the restored [[Kingdom of Hungary]] by a vote of **141 to 9** with one abstention.

---

## 2. Political System: Authoritarian Conservatism

### The "Kingdom Without a King"

Hungary's constitutional arrangement was unique in Europe:

- The state was legally a **monarchy** but had no king
- The [[Allies of World War I]] would not tolerate any Habsburg restoration
- Horthy served as regent with most royal prerogatives:
  - Power to appoint/dismiss prime ministers
  - Authority to convene/dissolve parliament
  - Command of armed forces

### Habsburg Restoration Attempts

[[Charles IV of Austria|King Karl IV]] returned from exile twice in 1921 attempting to reclaim his throne. Horthy rebuffed him both times due to:
- Vehemently negative Allied reaction
- Desire to protect his own power

### Character of the Regime

The Horthy system has been variously characterized:

| Perspective | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Conservative view | Stable, traditional order that rebuilt the nation |
| Critical view | Para-fascist system enabling later collaboration |
| Moderate view | Authoritarian but not totalitarian; preserved parliamentary forms |

Key features:
- **Conservative nationalist** ideology
- **Fiercely anti-communist** orientation
- Relied on traditional economic elites and bureaucracy
- Maintained parliamentary system with restricted suffrage
- Never established a one-party state

> [!quote] Historian Ignac Romsics
> "He was openly anti-democratic... [but] not a military dictator like Spain's Franco or Romania's Antonescu."

### The Bethlen Era (1921-1931)

Prime Minister [[Istvan Bethlen]] achieved political stabilization:

- Disbanded far-right militias
- Concluded secret pact with Social Democrats (December 1921)
- Found government employment for right-wing radical leaders
- Obtained [[League of Nations]] loans for economic recovery
- Introduced the [[pengo]] currency (1927)
- Rejected antisemitism as instrument of social change

---

## 3. Irredentism and the Treaty of Trianon

### The Treaty of Trianon (June 4, 1920)

The [[Treaty of Trianon]] was signed at the Grand Trianon chateau in Versailles, inflicting what Hungarians call the "Trianon trauma":

**Territorial losses:**
- Pre-war territory: 325,411 km²
- Post-Trianon territory: 93,073 km² (**72% loss**)

**Population losses:**
- Pre-war population: 20.9 million
- Post-Trianon population: 7.6 million (**64% loss**)
- 3.3 million ethnic Hungarians became minorities in successor states

**Territorial redistribution:**
- [[Slovakia]] and [[Ruthenia]] → [[Czechoslovakia]]
- [[Transylvania]] and most of [[Banat]] → [[Romania]]
- [[Croatia-Slavonia]] and southern areas → [[Yugoslavia]]

### Hungarian Irredentism

Revisionism became the central pillar of Hungarian politics:

- Slogan: "Nem, nem, soha!" ("No, no, never!")
- Virtually all political groups advocated treaty revision
- Goal: recover "occupied territories" and reunite ethnic Hungarians

> [!important] Historian Eva S. Balogh
> "Hungary's participation in World War II resulted from a desire to revise the Treaty of Trianon so as to recover territories lost after World War I."

---

## 4. Anti-Jewish Legislation

### Numerus Clausus Law (September 1920)

**Act XXV/1920** holds the distinction of being **the first antisemitic law in post-WWI Europe**:

- Limited university enrollment for Jewish students to their share of total population (~6%)
- Previously, Jews comprised ~25% of university students
- Defined Jews as a separate "racial" or "national" group
- Abrogated the principle of equal rights enshrined since Jewish emancipation

**Impact:**
- Thousands of Hungarian Jewish students (the "NC exiles") fled abroad
- Law amended in 1928, quota reintroduced in 1939
- Abolished only in 1945

> [!note] Historical Significance
> Historians agree that this law "paved the way for the openly discriminatory anti-Jewish laws enacted in Hungary in the late 1930s and, ultimately, the Hungarian Holocaust."

### The Three Jewish Laws (1938-1941)

| Law | Date | Key Provisions |
|-----|------|----------------|
| **First Jewish Law** | May 29, 1938 | Restricted Jews to 20% in enterprises, press, professions |
| **Second Jewish Law** | May 5, 1939 | Racial definition (2+ Jewish grandparents); tightened quotas to 6%; restricted voting rights |
| **Third Jewish Law** | August 8, 1941 | Prohibited intermarriage; criminalized sexual relations between Jews and non-Jews |

**Consequences:**
- 250,000 Hungarian Jews lost their income
- Most lost voting rights
- Between May 1938 and March 1944: **22 antisemitic laws** and **267 anti-Jewish decrees**

### Horthy's Personal Views

In an October 1940 letter to Prime Minister [[Pal Teleki]], Horthy wrote:

> "I have been an anti-Semite throughout my life. I have never had contact with Jews. I have considered it intolerable that here in Hungary everything, every factory, bank, large fortune, business, theatre, press, commerce, etc. should be in Jewish hands."

---

## 5. Alliance with Nazi Germany

### Joining the Axis

Key dates in Hungary's alignment with Germany:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| November 20, 1940 | Hungary joins [[Tripartite Pact]] |
| December 12, 1940 | Treaty of "permanent peace and eternal friendship" with Yugoslavia |
| April 3, 1941 | PM [[Pal Teleki]] commits suicide over betrayal of Yugoslavia treaty |
| April 6, 1941 | Hungary participates in invasion of Yugoslavia |
| June 27, 1941 | Hungary enters war against USSR |

### The Vienna Awards

Germany and Italy rewarded Hungarian loyalty with territorial revisions:

**First Vienna Award (November 2, 1938):**
- Returned southern [[Slovakia]] (Felvidek) to Hungary
- Czechoslovakia lost ~12,000 km² and ~1 million inhabitants

**March 1939:**
- Hitler permitted Hungary to occupy remainder of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]
- Restored common Hungarian-Polish border

**Second Vienna Award (August 30, 1940):**
- Awarded [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary
- Hungary gained 43,104 km² from Romania

> [!warning] Post-War Reversal
> All territorial gains were voided by the Paris Peace Treaties of February 10, 1947, restoring the Trianon borders.

---

## 6. WWII Military Participation

### Invasion of Yugoslavia (April 1941)

After Yugoslavia's coup against the Axis-friendly regent:
- Hungarian Third Army occupied [[Vojvodina]] in northern Serbia
- Annexed sections of [[Baranja]], [[Backa]], [[Medjimurje]], and [[Prekmurje]]
- PM Teleki's suicide note: he could not prevent Hungary becoming "a body-snatcher"

### The Kassa Bombing and Entry into War Against USSR

- **June 26, 1941**: Unidentified aircraft bombed [[Kassa]] (now Kosice, Slovakia)
- Hungarian authorities assumed Soviet responsibility
- Some historians speculate this was a German/Romanian false-flag operation
- Hungary declared war on the USSR the following day

### The Novi Sad Massacre (January 1942)

Hungarian forces conducted brutal "anti-partisan" operations in occupied [[Backa]]:

**Timeline:**
- January 4-23, 1942: Series of raids on towns and villages
- January 21-23: Massacre in Novi Sad

**Method:**
- Civilians shot on streets or taken to Danube shore
- Victims shot one by one; bodies thrown into frozen river

**Casualties:**
- 3,000-4,000 civilians killed in Novi Sad area
- Total "Great Razzia": at least 12,763 victims
- Victims: 70-75% Serbs, remainder Jews, Roma, Rusyns

**Aftermath:**
- Prosecutions began during the war
- Most perpetrators fled to Germany

- Hungarian President apologized in Belgrade in 2013

### The Kamenets-Podolsk Massacre (August 1941)

The first large-scale Holocaust massacre:

**Background:**
- Hungary deported Jews who could not prove citizenship
- By August 10, 1941: ~14,000 Jews deported to German-controlled territory
- Additional 4,000 deported later in August

**The Massacre (August 27-28, 1941):**
- [[Einsatzgruppen]] and SS units under General [[Friedrich Jeckeln]]
- **23,600 Jews killed** in mass shooting
- More than half were Hungarian deportees
- Largest Nazi massacre of Jews up to that point

**Survivors:**
- Only 2,000-3,000 deportees managed to return to Hungary

### The Don River Disaster (January 1943)

The greatest defeat in Hungarian military history:

**The Hungarian Second Army:**
- Deployed to Eastern Front from March 1942
- 207,000 soldiers plus 30,000 civilians (including Jewish forced laborers)
- Positioned along River Don by September 1942

**Soviet Offensive (January 13-17, 1943):**
- [[Voronezh-Kharkov Offensive]] completely destroyed the Second Army
- Commander General [[Gusztav Jany]] forbade withdrawal while German/Italian forces retreated
- Most units encircled and annihilated
- Extreme cold: -30°C to -40°C

**Casualties:**

> [!quote] Hungarian Collective Memory
> "In the Hungarian collective memory, both the Don tragedy and Mohacs are remembered as the worst military failures of Hungarian history."

## 7. The Holocaust in Hungary

### Jewish Population Before the Holocaust

In March 1944:
- **760,000-825,000 Jews** lived in Greater Hungary
- This was the **largest Jewish population remaining in Europe**

### The Labor Service System (Munkaszolgalat)

Established 1919, transformed into forced labor for Jews in 1938:

**Scale:**
- ~100,000 Jewish men conscripted
- ~45,000 sent with Second Army to Eastern Front

**Conditions:**
- No weapons or military uniforms
- Forced to clear minefields
- Subject to torture, starvation, abuse
- Some pushed off quarry cliffs to their deaths

**Death toll:**
- ~80% of Jewish forced laborers never returned
- Notable victims: poet [[Miklos Radnoti]], writer [[Antal Szerb]]

### German Occupation (March 19, 1944)

**Trigger:** The Kallay government's secret armistice negotiations with Allies

**Events:**
- German forces occupied Hungary without resistance
- [[Adolf Eichmann]] arrived to supervise deportations
- Horthy appointed pro-German [[Dome Sztojay]] as Prime Minister

### The Deportations (May-July 1944)

The most rapid and efficient mass deportation of the Holocaust:

**Timeline:**
| Period | Events |
|--------|--------|
| April 1944 | Jews concentrated in transit ghettos |
| May 15, 1944 | Mass deportations begin |
| July 6, 1944 | Horthy orders halt to deportations |
| July 9, 1944 | Deportations officially end |

**Scale:**
- **147 trains** departed for [[Auschwitz]]
- **434,000+ Jews** deported in 56 days
- **~80% gassed on arrival**
- Only Budapest's ~200,000 Jews remained

**Hungarian Collaboration:**
The deportations were accomplished with "unexpected zeal":
- [[Gendarmerie]] (csendorseg) played central role
- Interior ministry officials: [[Andor Jaross]], [[Laszlo Baky]], [[Laszlo Endre]]
- Regional officials, mayors, police cooperated fully

> [!quote] Historical Assessment
> "The speed with which the Hungarian authorities cast out Jews from society, then robbed, segregated and deported them was unprecedented in the entire history of the Holocaust."

### Why Horthy Halted Deportations

Multiple factors:
- Allied bombing of Budapest
- Diplomatic pressure (including from Pope and Swedish King)
- Threat of war crimes prosecution
- Military situation deteriorating

---

## 8. Attempt to Switch Sides (October 1944)

### The Kallay Government's Secret Negotiations (1942-1944)

PM [[Miklos Kallay]] (March 1942 - March 1944):
- Secretly negotiated with Western Allies in Turkey, Portugal, Sweden
- Sabotaged economic cooperation with Germany
- Protected refugees and resisted Nazi pressure on Jews
- September 9-10, 1943: Signed preliminary ceasefire agreement

**German response:** Occupation of March 19, 1944

### Horthy's Armistice Attempt (October 1944)

**Timeline:**
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| September 1944 | Soviet forces cross Hungarian border |
| September 24 | Horthy sends delegation to Moscow |
| October 8 | Soviets present ceasefire terms |
| October 11 | Preliminary armistice signed |
| October 15 | Horthy announces armistice on radio |

### Operation Panzerfaust

Germany's response was swift and brutal:

- [[Otto Skorzeny]] and commandos deployed to Budapest
- Horthy's son [[Miklos Horthy Jr.]] kidnapped
- Horthy faced ultimatum: rescind armistice or son dies

> [!quote] Horthy's Explanation
> "I neither resigned nor appointed Szalasi Premier, I merely exchanged my signature for my son's life."

### Why the Armistice Failed

1. **Too late**: Soviet troops already in eastern Hungary
2. **Military resistance**: Pro-German Hungarian officers refused orders
3. **Propaganda legacy**: 25 years of anti-Soviet state propaganda
4. **Organizational failures**: Poor planning and security breaches
5. **German preemption**: Swift commando action

---

## 9. Arrow Cross Takeover and Aftermath

### The Arrow Cross Party

**Nyilaskeresztes Part - Hungarista Mozgalom** (Arrow Cross Party - Hungarist Movement):
- Founded by [[Ferenc Szalasi]] in 1935
- Far-right, ultranationalist, violently antisemitic
- Szalasi named "Leader of the Nation" on October 15, 1944

### Reign of Terror (October 1944 - March 1945)

**Duration:** Less than 5 months of actual authority

**Atrocities:**
- 10,000-15,000 Jews shot along Danube banks
- Bodies thrown into the river
- 80,000 Jews deported on death marches to Austria
- Total murdered: 15,000-38,000

### The Budapest Ghetto

**Established:** November 29, 1944
- 70,000 Jews confined to 0.1 square miles
- Cut off from food, medical care, garbage collection
- Thousands died of cold, disease, starvation
- Dead bodies piled in streets

**Planned Massacre Prevented:**
- [[Raoul Wallenberg]] learned of Eichmann's massacre plan
- Threatened German commander [[Gerhard Schmidhuber]] with war crimes prosecution
- Massacre cancelled at last minute

### Liberation

- **January 17-18, 1945**: Soviet troops liberate Budapest Ghetto
- **February 13, 1945**: Budapest fully liberated

**Survivors in Budapest:**
- ~25,000 in "international" ghetto (with protective papers)
- ~69,000 in main ghetto
- ~25,000 hiding with false papers
- **Total: ~119,000**

### Arrow Cross Aftermath

**March 1946:** Szalasi and three key accomplices hanged as war criminals

---

## 10. Death Toll and Historical Assessment

### Total Jewish Victims

| Category | Estimated Deaths |
|----------|------------------|
| Before German occupation (1941-1944) | ~63,000 |
| Deportations to Auschwitz (1944) | ~430,000 |
| Arrow Cross killings | 15,000-38,000 |
| Labor service deaths | ~50,000 |
| **Total Hungarian Jewish victims** | **550,000-568,000** |

### Other Victims

| Event | Victims |
|-------|---------|
| White Terror (1919-1921) | 1,500-5,000 |
| Kamenets-Podolsk massacre | 16,000-18,000 (Hungarian deportees) |
| Novi Sad massacre | 3,000-4,000 |
| Don River disaster | 100,000-120,000 (military) |

### Survivors

From ~825,000 Jews in 1941 Greater Hungary:
- ~255,500 survived the war
- Survival rate: ~31%

## 11. Post-War Fate and Legacy Debates

### Horthy's Fate

**Capture and Detention:**
- Taken to Germany as prisoner after October 1944
- Fell into American custody as war ended
- Detained at Nuremberg prison (September 1945)

**Nuremberg:**
- **Not indicted for war crimes**
- Served as witness against Nazi defendants
- Testified against [[Edmund Veesenmayer]] in 1948

**Release and Exile:**
- Released December 17, 1945
- Lived in Weilheim, Bavaria (1945-1949)
- Supported by American diplomats and Pope Pius XII
- Moved to Estoril, Portugal as permanent exile

**Death:**
- Died February 9, 1957 in Portugal
- Will requested: no return to Hungary "until the last Russian soldier has left"

### Reburial Controversy (1993)

- Body returned to Hungary in 1993 (after Soviet withdrawal)
- Reburied in Kenderes with ceremony broadcast on state television
- Sparked significant political controversy

### Contemporary Legacy Debates

**Rehabilitation Attempts:**

The Orban government has been accused of rehabilitating Horthy:
- 2017: Orban called Horthy an "exceptional statesman"
- Museum narratives minimize Hungarian Holocaust culpability
- Statues erected in villages (e.g., Hajdubagos, 2021)
- "Memorial to Victims of German Occupation" (2014) criticized for implying Hungary was occupied victim

**Critical Perspectives:**

The [[US Holocaust Memorial Museum]] position:
> "In terms of the Holocaust, Horthy's record was one of direct culpability... Horthy accepted the entry of German military forces and an SS contingent led by Adolf Eichmann into Hungary in March 1944, and ordered his own military and civil authorities to put up no resistance."

**U.S. Government Statement:**
> "Miklos Horthy was complicit in the slaughter of Hungary's Jewish population during the Holocaust. The United States is concerned by the participation of a senior Orban government official in efforts to rehabilitate and promote his brutal legacy."

### Historical Assessment: Key Questions

1. **Was Horthy a fascist?**
   - British historian Norman Stone: "It is quite wrong to identify Horthy with Fascism"
   - Others describe the regime as "para-fascist"
   - Regime never established one-party state or personality cult

2. **Was Horthy responsible for the Holocaust?**
   - Passed antisemitic laws years before Nazi pressure
   - Numerus clausus (1920) preceded Nuremberg Laws by 15 years
   - Permitted deportation of 437,000 Jews in 1944
   - Also halted deportations in July 1944, sparing Budapest Jews

3. **Collaborator or reluctant ally?**
   - Alliance with Germany driven by irredentism, not ideology
   - Attempted to switch sides (too late, ineffectively)
   - Never established concentration camps in Hungary proper (until 1944)

> [!important] Historian's Conclusion
> "Would Horthy cooperate with Hitler's Final Solution, allowing the deportations of Budapest's Jews to the gas chambers, or would he somehow resist and incur the Fuehrer's wrath? This issue of collaboration with Hitler was fraught with peril then and remains controversial now in the portrayal of Hungarian history."

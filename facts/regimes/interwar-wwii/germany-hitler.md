## Pre-Conditions

### Weimar Republic Weaknesses (1919-1933)
Germany's first democratic government suffered from multiple structural weaknesses:
- **Constitutional flaws**: Proportional representation led to fragmented parliaments; Article 48 allowed emergency presidential decrees bypassing the Reichstag
- **Political instability**: Multiple coalition governments, frequent elections, political violence between left and right
- **"Stab-in-the-back myth"**: Many Germans blamed democratic politicians for "stabbing" the army in the back by surrendering in WWI

### Treaty of Versailles (1919)
Signed June 28, 1919, imposing harsh terms:
- **War guilt clause**: Germany forced to accept sole responsibility for WWI
- **Territorial losses**: Alsace-Lorraine to France, Polish Corridor created, colonies confiscated
- **Military restrictions**: Army limited to 100,000 men, no air force, no tanks
- **Reparations**: Initially set at 132 billion gold marks (~$33 billion)

The treaty was labeled "the Diktat" by Germans and galvanized resentment.

### Hyperinflation Crisis (1921-1923)
- **Cause**: Government printed money to pay debts and striking workers in French-occupied Ruhr
- **Scale**: In 1919, one loaf of bread cost 1 mark; by November 1923, 100 billion marks
- **Peak**: November 1923 — one US dollar = 1 trillion marks
- **Impact**: Middle class savings wiped out overnight; undermined faith in the republic

### Great Depression Impact (1929-1933)
- **October 29, 1929**: US stock market crash triggered global depression
- **Germany's vulnerability**: Economy dependent on American loans
- **Unemployment**: From ~2 million (1926) to ~6 million (1932) — approximately 30% of workforce
- **Political radicalization**: Nazi Reichstag seats: 12 (1928) → 107 (1930) → 230 (July 1932)

## Scholarly Debate

### Intentionalist vs. Functionalist Debate

**Central question**: Was the Holocaust planned from the beginning or did it evolve?

**Intentionalist position** (Dawidowicz, Jackel):
- Hitler planned Jewish extermination as early as 1918
- He personally oversaw its execution

**Functionalist position** (Broszat, Mommsen, Hilberg):
- Holocaust emerged incrementally through bureaucratic competition
- No single written Hitler order has been found

**Current synthesis** (Kershaw, Bauer):
- Hitler was the driving force but without detailed long-term plan
- Much initiative came "from below" as officials competed to fulfill Hitler's wishes ("working towards the Fuhrer")

### The "Willing Executioners" Debate

**Daniel Goldhagen's thesis** (1996):
- Ordinary Germans were "willing executioners" due to unique "eliminationist antisemitism" in German culture

**Responses**:
- **Christopher Browning** (*Ordinary Men*): Same evidence, different conclusion — conformity, peer pressure, and obedience, not unique German antisemitism
- Academic consensus largely rejected Goldhagen's monocausal explanation

### Economic Factors in Nazi Rise
- **Debate**: How central was economic crisis?
- **Consensus**: Depression was necessary but not sufficient; it created conditions that Nazi organization and propaganda exploited

- [[soviet-union-stalin]] — relationship: thematic (totalitarian comparison)
- [[italy-mussolini]] — relationship: causal (Mussolini influenced Hitler's early tactics)
- [[japan-wwii]] — relationship: temporal (Axis alliance)

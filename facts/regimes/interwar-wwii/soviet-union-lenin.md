## Pre-Conditions

### World War I and the Collapse of Tsarism
- **Economic devastation**: Real wages fell to ~50% of 1913 levels by 1917; national debt reached 50 billion rubles
- **Military catastrophe**: Russian armies suffered stunning defeats with millions of casualties
- **Food shortages**: Severe privation across the empire, especially in cities
- **Loss of confidence**: Government corruption and military failures discredited Tsarist rule

### The February Revolution (March 1917)
- **Trigger**: Food riots in Petrograd (St. Petersburg) in late February/early March 1917
- **Outcome**: Tsar Nicholas II abdicated on March 2 (Old Style), ending 300 years of Romanov rule
- **Provisional Government**: Liberal-democratic government formed under Prince Lvov, later Alexander Kerensky
- **Dual Power**: Petrograd Soviet emerged as parallel center of worker/soldier power

### Failure of the Provisional Government
- Continued unpopular participation in World War I
- Failed to address land redistribution demands
- Economic crisis worsened
- Growing unrest among workers, soldiers, and peasants
- Lost credibility after failed June Offensive and Kornilov Affair (August 1917)

### Lenin's Return
- Lenin had been living in exile in Switzerland during WWI
- Germany facilitated his return via "sealed train" (April 1917), hoping he would destabilize Russia
- April 4, 1917: Lenin issued "April Theses" calling Bolsheviks to oppose Provisional Government and end the war
- Slogan: "Peace, Land, and Bread"

---

## Rise to Power

### Building Bolshevik Support (April-October 1917)
- Bolshevik Party membership grew from 24,000 (February 1917) to 200,000 (September 1917)
- Gained control of Petrograd Soviet by September 1917
- Revolutionary Military Committee established under Trotsky's leadership
- 50,000 workers passed resolution favoring transfer of power to Soviets

### The October Revolution (November 7-8, 1917)
- **Night of October 24-25 (November 6-7, New Style)**: Bolshevik Red Guards seized control of Petrograd
- Key targets: railway stations, telegraph offices, bridges, government buildings
- **Winter Palace**: Seat of Provisional Government fell on evening of October 25/26
- **Remarkably bloodless**: Initial seizure occurred largely without casualties
- Provisional Government ministers arrested; Kerensky fled

### First Decrees
- **Decree on Peace** (October 26): Proposed immediate negotiations to end WWI
- **Decree on Land** (October 26): Abolished private land ownership; distributed land to peasants
- **Decree on Press** (October 27): Authorized closure of "hostile" publications
- **Treaty of Brest-Litovsk** (March 1918): Ended Russian participation in WWI; ceded vast territories to Germany

### The Russian Civil War (1918-1922)
**Causes**:
- Opposition to Bolshevik coup from monarchists, liberals, and moderate socialists
- Treaty of Brest-Litovsk angered nationalists
- War Communism policies alienated peasants
- Foreign intervention by Allied powers (Britain, France, US, Japan)

**Opposing Forces**:
- **Red Army**: Bolshevik forces reorganized by Trotsky
- **White Armies**: Loose coalition of anti-Bolshevik forces (monarchists, republicans, nationalists)
- **Green Armies**: Peasant forces that fought both sides
- **Nationalist movements**: Independence struggles in Ukraine, Baltic states, Caucasus, Central Asia

**Trotsky's Leadership**:
- Appointed People's Commissar for Military Affairs (1918)
- Rebuilt Red Army from remnants of old Tsarist forces
- Controversially recruited former Tsarist officers (with political commissars to ensure loyalty)
- Instituted conscription and military intelligence
- Even Stalin acknowledged: "The Party is indebted primarily and principally to Comrade Trotsky for the rapid going over of the garrison to the side of the Soviet"

**Outcome**: Red Army victory by 1922

**Casualties**: 7-12 million total deaths (mostly civilian), including combat, disease (3 million from typhus), terror, and displacement

---

## Methods of Control

### The Cheka (Secret Police)

**Establishment**: December 20, 1917, by decree of the Council of People's Commissars

**Official Name**: All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage (VChK)

**Leadership**: Felix Dzerzhinsky ("Iron Felix") served as chairman from 1917 until his death in 1926

**Methods**:
- Mass arrests, imprisonment, and torture without trial
- Summary executions in prison basements and public places
- Establishment of concentration camps
- Vast network of informants
- Hostage-taking and collective punishment

**Scale**: By end of Civil War (1922), the Cheka had at least 200,000 personnel

**Dzerzhinsky's Statement**: "We represent in ourselves organized terror—this must be said very clearly"

### The Red Terror (1918-1922)

**Trigger**: Assassination attempts on Lenin (August 30, 1918) and killings of Bolshevik officials Moisei Uritsky and V. Volodarsky

**Official Decree**: September 5, 1918 — Decree on Red Terror ordered:
- Mass shootings "to be inflicted without hesitation"
- "Securing the Soviet Republic from class enemies by isolating them in concentration camps"

**Implementation**:
- Immediate massacre of ~1,300 "bourgeois hostages" in Petrograd and Kronstadt prisons
- Lenin's "hanging order" (August 9, 1918): Instructed communists in Penza to publicly hang 100 kulaks as deterrent
- Pyatigorsk Cheka organized "day of Red Terror" to execute 300 in one day, with quotas from each district
- Kislovodsk Cheka "for lack of a better idea" killed all patients in the hospital

**Targets**:
- "Counter-revolutionaries" (broadly defined)
- Non-Bolshevik socialists (Mensheviks, Socialist Revolutionaries)
- Whites and Tsarist supporters
- Liberals and bourgeoisie
- Clergy and religious figures
- Kulaks (wealthy peasants)

**Atrocities Against Clergy**: According to documents cited by Alexander Yakovlev, priests, monks, and nuns were crucified, thrown into boiling tar, scalped, strangled, given "Communion" with melted lead, and drowned in ice holes

**Death Toll Estimates**:
| Source | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| Official Bolshevik figures | ~8,500 |
| Martin Latsis (Cheka official) | 12,733 (1917-1920) |
| William Henry Chamberlin | ~50,000 |
| George Leggett | ~140,000 |
| Robert Conquest | 140,000 (1917-1922) |
| Hudson Institute | 200,000 (1918-1922) |
| V. Erlikhman (Russian historian) | 1,200,000 |
| Dietrich Beyrau | Up to 1,300,000 |

**Scholarly Assessment**: Evan Mawdsley writes that the lowest estimates "seem too low, and Conquest's too high," suggesting Chamberlin and Leggett's figures (50,000-140,000) are "more plausible"

### War Communism (1918-1921)

**Key Features**:
- Expropriation of private businesses
- Nationalization of all industry
- Forced requisition of grain (prodrazvyorstka) from peasants
- Abolition of money (payment in kind)
- Labor conscription
- State distribution of consumer goods

**Consequences**:
- Industrial output in 1921 was only 12% of 1913 levels
- Agricultural harvest less than half pre-war average
- Economy collapsed; bartering became essential for survival
- Peasant resentment led to armed uprisings
- Contributed directly to 1921-1922 famine

### Press Censorship

**Decree on Press** (October 27, 1917):
- Issued just two days after seizure of Winter Palace
- Authorized closure of publications that:
  - Incited resistance to the government
  - "Sowed confusion" through "calumniatory perversion of facts"
  - Incited criminal acts
- Described as "temporary" measure to be repealed "as soon as normal conditions of social life set in"

**Implementation**:
- October 26, 1917: Closed Rech', Den', Novoe vremia, Vechernee vremia and other papers
- Bolsheviks requisitioned printing presses, buildings, and paper supplies
- Opposition papers evaded closure by changing names and offices
- By July 1918: All opposition publications closed
- Revolutionary Tribunal of Press (January 1918) prosecuted press "crimes"

**Pravda and Izvestia**: Became official organs of the Party and Soviet government respectively

## Key Events & Atrocities

### Execution of the Romanov Family (July 17, 1918)
- Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and their five children executed by Bolsheviks in Yekaterinburg
- Extended Romanov family members also killed
- Bodies concealed to prevent martyrdom

### De-Cossackization (1919-1920)
- Campaign to eliminate Cossacks as a distinct social group
- Directive of January 24, 1919 called for "mass terror" and "merciless struggle"
- Between 300,000-500,000 Cossacks killed
- Mass deportations and property confiscation

### Tambov Rebellion Suppression (1920-1921)
- Major peasant uprising against grain requisitions
- Suppressed with extreme violence
- Approximately 240,000 killed
- Poison gas reportedly used against peasant villages

### The Kronstadt Rebellion (March 1921)

**Background**: Sailors at Kronstadt naval base—who had been crucial supporters of the October Revolution—rose against Bolshevik rule

**Causes**:
- Deteriorating conditions: reduced food rations, fuel shortages, factory closures
- Ruthless suppression of strikes in Petrograd
- February 1921: Cheka reported 155 peasant uprisings across Russia
- Sailors witnessed contrast between revolutionary promises and reality during home leave

**Demands**:
- Free elections to Soviets ("Soviets without Bolsheviks")
- Freedom of speech and assembly
- Release of non-Bolshevik socialist prisoners
- End to Communist Party political monopoly
- End to War Communism policies

**Suppression**:
- Trotsky and Mikhail Tukhachevsky led assault across ice
- Rebellion crushed in 16 days
- ~2,000 sailors executed, most without trial
- Survivors sent to early labor camps

**Significance**: Demonstrated that even former revolutionary supporters had turned against Bolshevik policies; directly led to adoption of NEP

### The Russian Famine of 1921-1922

**Death Toll**: 5-10 million (scholarly consensus now suggests at least 6 million)

**Primary Region**: Volga and Ural River regions

**Causes**:
- Unprecedented drought: October 1920 to June 1921 saw only 2.75 inches of rainfall (vs. 14-inch average)
- War Communism grain requisitions discouraged production
- Years of war devastation (WWI and Civil War)
- Disease epidemics (typhus, cholera)
- Peasants had drastically reduced crop production due to confiscation policies

**Regional Impact**: Tatarstan lost at least 500,000 (official) to possibly 2,000,000 (scholarly estimates); ~13% fled, ~10% died

**International Relief**: American Relief Administration (ARA) provided over 768 million tons of food valued at $98 million; fed 10 million people daily at peak

### New Economic Policy (NEP) (1921-1928)

**Adoption**: March 1921, proposed by Lenin at 10th Party Congress

**Trigger**: Economic collapse, Kronstadt Rebellion, widespread peasant uprisings

**Key Features**:
- Abolished forced grain requisitions; replaced with tax in kind
- Allowed small-scale private enterprise
- Reintroduced money (1922)
- Permitted peasants to own and cultivate land
- State retained control of large industry, banks, and foreign trade

**Lenin's Justification**:
- Called it "a free market and capitalism, both subject to state control"
- Described as "state capitalism" — the "last stage before socialism"
- Acknowledged it as "taking one step backward to take two steps forward"

**Results**:
- Economic recovery after years of devastation
- By 1928: Agricultural and industrial production restored to 1913 pre-war levels
- "NEP men" — small businessmen who flourished in this period

**End**: Terminated by Stalin in 1928 with collectivization and full nationalization

## Death and Succession Crisis

### Lenin's Declining Health
- May 1922: First major stroke; partial paralysis
- December 1922-March 1923: Dictated "Testament" and other political documents
- March 1923: Third stroke left him largely incapacitated and unable to speak
- January 21, 1924: Fourth stroke; died at Gorki estate outside Moscow

**Official Cause**: "Incurable disease of the blood vessels"

**Alternative Theory**: Some historians suggest poison may have been involved; Stalin reportedly claimed Lenin asked to be "put out of his misery"

### Lenin's Testament (December 1922 - January 1923)

**Content**:
- Assessed six leading Bolsheviks: Stalin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Pyatakov
- Warned that Stalin had "concentrated enormous power in his hands" and might not "always know how to use this power with sufficient caution"
- Criticized Stalin's "rudeness," "capriciousness," and "disloyalty"
- Postscript (January 1923): Explicitly recommended Stalin's removal as General Secretary

**Suppression**:
- Krupskaya transmitted Testament to Central Committee in May 1924
- Central Committee (dominated by Stalin's allies) decided to read it only to individual delegations, not full Congress
- Publication prohibited
- Zinoviev and Kamenev supported Stalin
- Testament remained officially unpublished in USSR

### The Succession Struggle

**Triumvirate Formation** (1922-1924):
- Stalin, Zinoviev, and Kamenev formed alliance against Trotsky
- Initially, Zinoviev was most prominent of the three

**Trotsky's Defeat**:
- January 1925: Condemned at Central Committee plenum
- Lost position as Commissar of War
- Eventually expelled from party (1927), exiled to Alma-Ata (1928), expelled from USSR (1929)
- Assassinated in Mexico (1940) on Stalin's orders

**Stalin's Victory**:
- Maneuvered against each rival in turn
- By 1929: Politically defeated all major opponents
- See: [[soviet-union-stalin]]

## Aftermath

### Lenin's Cult of Personality

**Immediate Response to Death**:
- Massive public mourning mobilized by party
- Party leadership "became enthralled" by the outpouring and sought to perpetuate it

**Embalming Decision**:
- Against Lenin's wishes (and Krupskaya's objections), body was embalmed
- Three purposes: maintain cult, uphold Soviet legitimacy, prevent lavish ongoing funerals
- Embalming team led by Boris Zbarsky and Vladimir Vorobiev
- Body preserved with glycerol and potassium acetate solution (renewed annually)
- Synthetic eyeballs placed to prevent socket collapse

**The Mausoleum**:
- First wooden structure: completed January 27, 1924 (same day as funeral)
- Opened to public: August 1, 1924
- Permanent granite/marble structure: completed 1930
- Became key symbol of Soviet power
- Politburo tradition of standing atop during parades

**Propaganda Functions**:
- "Immortal Leader" imagery for peasant and worker "pilgrims"
- Lenin's "spirit" used to direct people toward socialist ideals
- Explicitly religious overtones despite official atheism
- Comparison to veneration of saints' relics

### Stalin's Appropriation of Lenin's Legacy
- Stalin positioned himself as Lenin's true heir and interpreter
- Lenin's works became sacred texts
- Marxism-Leninism established as official ideology
- Stalin's body briefly placed beside Lenin's (1953-1961) before de-Stalinization

---

## Scholarly Debate

### Was Lenin's Regime Totalitarian?

**Totalitarian Interpretation** (Richard Pipes, Leonard Schapiro, and others):
- Pipes: "The Russia of 1917-1924 was no less 'totalitarian' than the Russia of the 1930s"
- Argues the system Lenin built was "not misused by Stalin, but rather wielded exactly as Lenin had intended"
- Marxist-Leninist ideology led "inexorably" to hierarchical, centralized, violent rule
- Terror and coercion were required because Marxist-Leninist socialism had "negligible support" from Russian people

**Modified Totalitarian View** (Robert Service):
- Soviet state was "totalitarian in its goals and intentions, but not in its actual functioning"
- Room existed for popular resistance through falsification, slack work, family ties
- Foundations for Stalinism were laid, but passage was "not smooth and inevitable"

**Revisionist Interpretation** (J. Arch Getty, Sheila Fitzpatrick):
- Emphasizes social history over top-down ideological explanation
- Questions whether "totalitarian" model captures reality of Soviet governance
- Interested in how society shaped party as well as vice versa

### Continuity Question: Lenin to Stalin

**Continuity Argument**:
- Richard Pipes: Stalinism was "prefigured by Lenin's ideology"; Stalin "faithfully implemented Lenin's domestic and foreign policy programs"
- Stephen Kotkin: Stalin's "violence was not the product of his subconscious but of the Bolshevik engagement with Marxist-Leninist ideology"
- Cheka, concentration camps, Red Terror, one-party rule all established under Lenin

**Discontinuity Argument**:
- Stephen Cohen: Stalin "broke free from the ideology of Marx and Lenin"
- Robert Service: Lenin "laid foundations for a Stalin... but passage from Leninism to worse terrors of Stalinism was not smooth and inevitable"
- NEP suggests Lenin was capable of tactical flexibility absent in Stalin

### Post-1991 Archive Revelations
- Soviet archives opened after USSR collapse
- Documents show party leaders genuinely communicated in Marxist-Leninist idiom
- Also reveal significant debates and fissures among leaders on ideological questions
- Neither purely totalitarian nor purely revisionist interpretations fully confirmed
- Debate continues with new evidence

### The Terror Question: Reactive or Inherent?

**Reactive View**: Red Terror was response to genuine threats (Civil War, assassination attempts, foreign intervention)

**Inherent View**: Terror was "inevitability, given the history, ideology and methodology of the Bolshevik movement"

## Comparisons
- [[soviet-union-stalin]] — relationship: direct succession (Lenin's regime created institutional foundations for Stalinism)
- [[germany-hitler]] — relationship: thematic (totalitarian comparison; both used secret police and political terror)
- [[china-mao]] — relationship: ideological (Marxist-Leninist successor state)

## Confidence Assessment
**Overall**: High

**Notes**:
- Lenin's regime is extensively documented by historians
- Death toll estimates for Red Terror vary significantly (8,500 to 1.3 million) — ranges provided reflect genuine scholarly uncertainty
- Civil War and famine casualties are better established (7-12 million total)
- Pre-conditions and rise to power well-established in scholarship
- Scholarly debates on Lenin-Stalin continuity are ongoing
- Post-1991 archive access has enriched but not fully resolved interpretive disputes

**Public opinion** (2013 poll): ~85% felt Mao's achievements outweighed mistakes

**Censorship**: Opposition to Mao can lead to censorship or professional repercussions

## Scholarly Debate

### Death Toll Estimates: Why Such Variation?

**Sources of uncertainty**:
- Limited access to official records
- Classified "state secrets" in China
- Different methodologies
- Incomplete death registration during famine
- Difficulty separating campaign deaths
- Political motivations on both sides

### Great Leap Forward: Incompetence vs. Intentional?

**"Incompetence" view**:
- Disaster stemmed from structural nature of centralized rule
- "Perfect storm of incompetence, overzealousness, fear, faulty ideology, and stubbornness"
- False reporting by lower cadres (afraid after Anti-Rightist Campaign)
- Upper ranks didn't question exaggerated figures

**"Intentional" view**:
- Frank Dikotter: Mao and CCP intentionally starved people
- March 1959: Mao allegedly said "Better to let half die so other half can eat their fill"
- Benjamin Valentino: "Black elements" given lowest food priority, died in greatest numbers

### Comparison to Stalin

**Similarities**:
- Both claimed "scientific socialism"
- Cult of personality as infallible leaders
- One-party state dominating traditional structures
- Mass murder and imprisonment
- Forced collectivization and rapid industrialization

**Differences**:
- Chinese laogai emphasized thought reform more than Soviet gulag
- Mao replaced industrial proletariat with peasants as revolutionary class
- Hannah Arendt: Mao's regime potentially lacked concept of "objective enemy"

## Comparisons
- [[soviet-union-stalin]] — relationship: structural (communist model); thematic (totalitarian comparison)
- [[germany-hitler]] — relationship: thematic (totalitarian comparison)

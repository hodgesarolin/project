## Pre-Conditions

### Yugoslav Political Crisis (1918-1941)
The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia from 1929) suffered from fundamental tensions:
- **Serbian-Croatian divide**: Croats resented what they perceived as Serbian political dominance
- **Constitutional disputes**: Centralized Belgrade government versus Croatian calls for federalism
- **The Croatian Peasant Party**: Under Stjepan Radic, became the main vehicle for Croatian political aspirations

### Assassination of Stjepan Radic (1928)
- **June 20, 1928**: Montenegrin Serb politician Punisa Racic shot Croatian parliamentarians in the Yugoslav Parliament
- **Deaths**: Two Croatian MPs killed immediately; Stjepan Radic mortally wounded, died August 8, 1928
- **Impact**: Deepened Croatian-Serbian divide; delegitimized parliamentary system in Croatian eyes
- **Succession**: Vladko Macek became leader of Croatian Peasant Party

### King Alexander's Dictatorship (1929-1934)
- **January 6, 1929**: King Alexander I abolished the constitution and established royal dictatorship
- **Actions**: Renamed country "Yugoslavia"; banned all political parties based on ethnic or religious identity
- **Croatian response**: Radicalized Croatian nationalists; drove Pavelic into exile
- **International context**: Rise of fascism in Italy provided model and support for Croatian extremists

### Formation of the Ustasha Movement (1929)
- **1927**: Pavelic, then a Zagreb city councilman, secretly contacted Mussolini
- **1929**: After fleeing Yugoslavia, Pavelic founded Ustasha movement in Italy
- **Full name**: Ustasa — Hrvatski revolucionarni pokret (Croatian Revolutionary Movement)
- **Ideology**: Croatian independence through terrorism and violence; modeled on Italian Fascism
- **Training camps**: Established in Italy (with Mussolini's funding) and Hungary

### Italian Support for Ustasha
Mussolini had strategic reasons to support Croatian separatism:
- **Treaty of London (1915)**: Italy had been promised Dalmatia but lost it to Yugoslavia at Versailles
- **Adriatic ambitions**: Italy sought to dominate the eastern Adriatic coast
- **Anti-Yugoslav policy**: Supporting Croatian terrorists weakened a regional rival
- **Funding and training**: Italy provided financial support and training facilities for Ustasha militants

### Assassination of King Alexander I (1934)
- **October 9, 1934**: King Alexander assassinated in Marseille, France
- **Perpetrator**: Vlado Chernozemski, Bulgarian IMRO operative working with Ustasha
- **French foreign minister Louis Barthou** also killed in the attack
- **First filmed political assassination**: Captured on newsreel cameras
- **Planning**: Joint Ustasha-IMRO operation, with probable Italian intelligence involvement
- **Aftermath**: Pavelic sentenced to death in absentia by France; remained protected in Italy

## Scholarly Debates

### Jasenovac Death Toll Controversy
The number of victims at Jasenovac remains one of the most contested questions:

**Historical range of estimates**:
- **1.1 million** (Antun Miletic, 1990s): Highest estimate; largely rejected by scholars
- **700,000-1 million** (Milan Bulajic, 1980s): Serbian nationalist estimate; considered greatly exaggerated
- **500,000-600,000** (1945 Yugoslav investigation): Early postwar estimate; now considered inflated
- **83,000** (Kocovic/Zerjavic, 1980s): Independent demographic calculations by Serbian and Croatian scholars
- **77,000-99,000** (current scholarly consensus): Range accepted by USHMM and most historians
- **80,000-120,000** (2024 Canadian Slavonic Papers): Recent scholarly estimate

**Jasenovac Memorial documentation**:
- **83,145 individual victims** identified by name
- Breakdown: 47,627 Serbs; 16,173 Roma; 13,116 Jews; 4,255 Croats; 1,128 Bosnian Muslims

**Reasons for controversy**:
- Destruction of records by Ustasha before camp liberation
- Political manipulation during communist Yugoslavia (inflated figures)
- Post-independence Croatian politics (some accused of minimizing)
- Serbian-Croatian nationalist tensions
- Limited independent scholarly access during Cold War

**Current scholarly position**:
- Estimates around 80,000-100,000 now widely accepted
- Even conservative estimates make Jasenovac one of the largest camps in Europe
- Exact figure may never be known due to destroyed documentation

### Total NDH Genocide Victims
Similar debates surround total victim numbers:
- **USHMM estimates**: 320,000-340,000 Serbs; 32,000 Jews; 25,000+ Roma
- **One in six Serbs killed**: Highest proportion of any ethnic group in Europe except Jews and Roma
- **Zerjavic calculation**: 322,000 Serbs killed in NDH (out of 1.8 million population)

### Role of Catholic Church
Scholarly debate continues over Church involvement:
- **Clerical participation**: Some priests actively participated in Ustasha; others sheltered victims
- **Archbishop Stepinac**: Controversial figure; initially welcomed NDH, later criticized some excesses
- **Vatican response**: Pope received Pavelic; Vatican assisted his escape; extent of knowledge debated
- **Forced conversions**: Church benefited from conversions but some clergy opposed violence

### Comparative Brutality
Debate over characterizing Ustasha violence:
- **German reactions**: Nazi officials' expressions of shock at Ustasha brutality documented
- **Primitive methods**: Use of knives, hammers rather than "industrial" killing
- **Interpretation**: Some see this as evidence of exceptional savagery; others note Nazis killed far more efficiently

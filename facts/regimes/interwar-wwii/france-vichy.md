## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Country/Region** | France |
| **Dates** | July 10, 1940 - August 9, 1944 |
| **Official Name** | French State (Etat francais) |
| **Leader(s)** | Marshal Philippe Petain (1856-1951) |
| **Type** | Authoritarian collaborationist regime |
| **Duration** | 4 years, 1 month |
| **Capital** | Vichy (spa town in central France) |
| **Estimated Death Toll** | ~77,000 Jews deported (72,500 killed); ~30,000 Resistance killed; ~650,000 sent to forced labor in Germany |

Vichy France, officially the French State (Etat francais), was the collaborationist government that ruled France from July 1940 to August 1944 following France's defeat by Nazi Germany. Named after its seat of government in the spa town of Vichy, the regime was headed by Marshal Philippe Petain, a World War I hero who became the symbol of France's capitulation and collaboration with the Nazi occupiers.

> [!important] Key Distinction
> The Vichy regime was not simply a puppet government imposed by Germany. As historian Robert Paxton demonstrated, Vichy actively sought collaboration with Nazi Germany and initiated many antisemitic policies independently, without German pressure. This willing collaboration fundamentally reshaped French historiography.

- National motto changed from "Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite" to "Travail, Famille, Patrie" (Work, Family, Fatherland)

---

## Pre-Conditions

### The Third Republic in Crisis (1930s)

France's Third Republic (1870-1940) had been weakened by multiple factors:

**Political instability:**
- Frequent government changes (over 40 governments between 1918-1940)
- Deep ideological divisions between left and right
- Strong anti-parliamentary movements on the far right
- February 6, 1934 crisis: Far-right riots nearly toppled the government

**The "Decadence" Narrative:**
- Widespread perception of national decline
- Blame assigned to democracy, Jews, Freemasons, and foreigners
- Charles Maurras and Action Francaise promoted reactionary Catholic nationalism
- Many conservatives viewed parliamentary democracy as inherently corrupt

**Economic and Social Tensions:**
- Great Depression impact, though less severe than Germany
- Popular Front government (1936-1938) polarized society
- Labor strikes and social unrest
- Middle-class fears of communism

### Military Weakness and Strategic Errors

**The Maginot Line mentality:**
- Defensive fortifications on Franco-German border
- False sense of security; did not extend to Belgian border
- Military doctrine favored static defense over mobile warfare

**Failure to modernize:**
- Interwar military thinking outdated
- Tank doctrine emphasized infantry support, not independent armored operations
- Air force inadequately integrated with ground operations

### The Fall of France (May-June 1940)

The Battle of France demonstrated catastrophic military and political failure:

**Timeline:**
- **May 10, 1940**: Germany invaded Low Countries and France
- **May 12-15, 1940**: German forces broke through at Sedan using combined arms tactics
- **May 20, 1940**: German forces reached the English Channel, splitting Allied armies
- **May 26-June 4, 1940**: Dunkirk evacuation; 338,000 Allied troops rescued
- **June 10, 1940**: Italy declared war on France
- **June 14, 1940**: Germans entered Paris (declared open city)
- **June 16, 1940**: Prime Minister Paul Reynaud resigned rather than sign armistice; replaced by Petain
- **June 17, 1940**: Petain announced intention to seek armistice
- **June 18, 1940**: De Gaulle broadcast from London calling for continued resistance
- **June 22, 1940**: Armistice signed at Compiegne (same rail car as 1918 German surrender)
- **June 25, 1940**: Armistice took effect

**The Scale of Defeat:**
- In just six weeks, Germany overran France
- French casualties: ~90,000 killed, 200,000 wounded
- 1.8 million French soldiers became POWs (held for duration of war)
- Psychological shock of rapid defeat created conditions for authoritarian takeover

---

## Rise to Power

### The Armistice of June 22, 1940

The armistice imposed harsh terms on France:

**Division of France:**
- Northern and western France (including Paris) under German military occupation
- "Free Zone" (Zone libre) in southern France nominally under French sovereignty
- Atlantic coast and Channel ports in Occupied Zone
- Approximately three-fifths of French territory occupied
- Alsace-Lorraine annexed by Germany (de facto)

**Other terms:**
- French army reduced to 100,000 men (mirroring Versailles Treaty terms on Germany)
- French navy to be disarmed and confined to port (crucial issue)
- Occupation costs of 400 million francs per day paid by France
- French POWs remained in German captivity as leverage

### End of the Third Republic (July 10, 1940)

The transition from Republic to authoritarian state was accomplished through legal means:

**July 9-10, 1940**: National Assembly convened at Vichy:
- Parliament voted 569-80 to grant full powers to Petain
- Authorized Petain to promulgate new constitution
- Effectively abolished Third Republic
- Only 80 deputies voted against (mostly Socialists and Radicals)

> [!quote] Constitutional Acts of July 11-12, 1940
> The Constitutional Acts granted Petain "all powers (legislative, judicial, administrative, executive and diplomatic)" and the title of "Head of the French State" (chef de l'Etat francais), as well as the right to nominate his successor.

### Establishment of the Vichy Regime

**Key features:**
- Petain assumed title "Head of State" (not President)
- Pierre Laval appointed Vice President of the Council and designated successor
- New motto: "Travail, Famille, Patrie" (Work, Family, Fatherland)
- Parliament suspended indefinitely
- Government relocated to Vichy spa town

**Why Vichy?**
- Major hotel infrastructure could house government ministries
- Excellent telephone communications
- In unoccupied southern zone
- Away from German-occupied Paris

---

## Ideology: The National Revolution (Revolution nationale)

The Vichy regime promoted a comprehensive ideological program known as the National Revolution:

### Core Principles

**Rejection of Republican values:**
- Democracy blamed for France's defeat and "decadence"
- Parliamentarism portrayed as corrupt and ineffective
- Revolutionary heritage of 1789 rejected
- Return to "traditional" French values

**Traditionalism:**
- Catholic values promoted (though regime not officially clerical)
- Family emphasized as fundamental social unit
- Rural life idealized over urban modernity
- Social hierarchy accepted as natural

**Corporatism:**
- Rejection of class conflict
- Labor and capital to cooperate under state guidance
- Professional corporations to replace trade unions
- Similar to Italian fascist corporatism

### "Enemies" of France

The National Revolution identified internal enemies responsible for France's decline:

**Jews:**
- Portrayed as fundamentally alien to French identity
- Blamed for materialism, capitalism, and communism simultaneously
- Subject to exclusionary legislation

**Freemasons:**
- Accused of secret manipulation of Republic
- Membership lists published; members banned from public office

**Communists:**
- Viewed as agents of foreign power (USSR)
- Resistance to occupation conflated with communist subversion

**Foreigners and refugees:**
- Blamed for diluting French identity
- Spanish Republican refugees particularly targeted
- Foreign Jews among first deportation victims

### The Petain Cult

**Petain as "Father":**
- Portrayed as paternal savior protecting France
- WWI hero status exploited for legitimacy
- "Marshal, we are here!" became official slogan
- Portraits mandatory in schools and public buildings
- Personal prestige distinguished from unpopular policies

> [!note] The "Shield" Theory
> Petain and his supporters claimed he served as a "shield" (bouclier) protecting France from the worst of German demands, while de Gaulle was the "sword" (epee). This myth was later demolished by historians, particularly Robert Paxton.

## Methods of Control

### Collaboration with Germany

**Types of collaboration:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **State collaboration** | Official government cooperation with occupation authorities |

### The Milice Francaise

The Milice was the most notorious instrument of Vichy repression:

**Formation:**

- Seized Jews, including children, for deportation
- More feared than German forces in many areas
- Estimated 25,000-35,000 members at peak

### Propaganda and Censorship

**Media control:**
- All newspapers censored; anti-Vichy publications banned
- Radio tightly controlled
- German propaganda mixed with Vichy messaging
- Films subject to censorship
- BBC broadcasts from London illegal but widely heard

**Education:**
- Curriculum revised to emphasize traditional values
- Teachers required to swear loyalty oath
- Jewish teachers dismissed
- History rewritten to emphasize French "grandeur" and blame Republicans

### Repression

**Measures against opposition:**
- Special tribunals for political crimes
- Internment camps for "undesirables" (Jews, foreigners, communists, resistance members)
- Hostage executions in reprisal for Resistance actions
- Strict curfews in occupied zone
- Identity cards and movement restrictions

**Changes after November 1942:**
- Germany occupied the Free Zone following Allied landings in North Africa
- Vichy lost last vestiges of autonomy
- Direct German supervision of French administration
- Milice given expanded powers

---

## Key Events and Atrocities

### Antisemitic Legislation

Vichy enacted antisemitic laws independently, without German pressure:

**First Statute on Jews (October 3, 1940):**
- Defined who was Jewish (more than two Jewish grandparents)
- Excluded Jews from public service, military, education
- Banned from press, radio, theater, and film
- Enacted *before* any German demand for such legislation

**Second Statute on Jews (June 2, 1941):**
- More extensive exclusions
- Census of all Jews in both zones
- Expanded definition of who qualified as Jewish

**Property confiscation:**
- "Aryanization" of Jewish businesses
- Commissariat General aux Questions Juives established (March 1941)
- Jewish property systematically seized

> [!important] Independent Action
> Historian Robert Paxton demonstrated that "the anti-Semitic policy of the French state was not imposed by Germany, but was desired in full autonomy by the French state." Vichy's Jewish statutes were enacted before Germany made any demands regarding Jews in the unoccupied zone.

### The Vel d'Hiv Roundup (July 16-17, 1942)

The largest mass arrest of Jews in France:

**The operation:**
- Organized by Rene Bousquet, Secretary General of Police
- Carried out entirely by French police (no German personnel)
- Target: 28,000 Jews in Paris region
- Actual arrests: ~13,000 men, women, and children

**The velodrome:**
- 8,000 Jews (including 4,000 children) held at Velodrome d'Hiver
- No food, water, or sanitary facilities for days
- Unbearable conditions in July heat

**Aftermath:**
- Victims sent to transit camps (Drancy, Pithiviers, Beaune-la-Rolande)
- Deported to Auschwitz
- Almost none survived
- Laval insisted children be deported with parents (against initial German orders)

> [!quote] President Emmanuel Macron (2017)
> "It was indeed France that organised this [roundup]... Not a single German took part."

### Deportation of Jews

**Overall deportation statistics:**
- ~77,000 Jews deported from France to Nazi death camps
- ~72,500 killed (overwhelmingly at Auschwitz)
- Approximately 2,500 survived deportation
- One-third of victims were French citizens; two-thirds were foreign or stateless Jews

**Timeline of deportations:**
- March 1942: First convoy to Auschwitz
- Summer 1942: Mass roundups in both zones
- January 1943: Deportations resumed after brief pause
- August 1944: Last deportations as Liberation approached

**The survival rate:**
- Overall Jewish survival rate in France: ~75% (one of highest in occupied Europe)
- Higher survival due to:
  - Geographic factors (distance from death camps)
  - Assistance from ordinary French citizens
  - Italian occupation zone (until September 1943) refused deportations
  - Shift in Vichy policy by 1943 as war turned against Germany

### Anti-Resistance Operations

**Repression of Resistance:**
- French police and Milice hunted Resistance members
- Torture used extensively
- Summary executions
- Hostage shootings (e.g., 50 hostages shot after each German officer killed)

**Key atrocities:**
- **Oradour-sur-Glane (June 10, 1944)**: SS Das Reich division massacred 642 villagers (including 247 children); Vichy provided intelligence
- **Gliere Plateau (March 1944)**: Milice and German forces attacked Maquis; ~130 killed
- **Vercors (July 1944)**: Major Resistance stronghold crushed; 840 Resistance and civilians killed

**Forced Labor (Service du travail obligatoire - STO):**
- February 1943: Compulsory labor service instituted
- ~650,000 French workers sent to Germany
- Many young men fled to join Maquis to avoid labor service
- Contributed significantly to Resistance growth

---

## Fall of Vichy

### The Liberation of France (1944)

**Allied invasion:**
- **June 6, 1944 (D-Day)**: Allied landings in Normandy
- **August 15, 1944**: Operation Dragoon landings in southern France
- Rapid Allied advance through France

**Paris liberated:**
- French Resistance launched uprising (August 19, 1944)
- General Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division and US 4th Infantry Division entered Paris
- **August 25, 1944**: German garrison surrendered
- De Gaulle marched down Champs-Elysees

### End of Vichy

**Collapse of regime:**
- **August 17, 1944**: Last Council of Ministers meeting
- **August 20, 1944**: Germans forced Petain and government to relocate to Belfort
- **September 7, 1944**: Moved to Sigmaringen Castle, Germany
- Vichy government in exile maintained pretense of legitimacy
- **April 1945**: Petain returned to France to face trial

### Charles de Gaulle and the Provisional Government

**Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF):**
- Established June 3, 1944 (before Liberation)
- De Gaulle as President
- Declared Vichy illegitimate ("The Republic never ceased to exist")
- Moved to Paris after Liberation

**De Gaulle's strategy:**
- Refused to declare new Republic (it had never ended)
- All Vichy acts declared null and void
- Asserted French sovereignty and resistance legacy
- Prevented Allied military government of France

---

## Aftermath

### The Purge (Epuration)

**Extrajudicial violence (epuration sauvage):**
- Summary executions during and after Liberation
- Estimates: 9,000-10,000 killed
- "Horizontal collaboration" - women who had relations with Germans publicly shamed (heads shaved)
- Violence peaked in summer 1944

**Legal purge (epuration legale):**
- ~300,000 cases investigated
- ~120,000 trials
- 6,763 death sentences (3,910 in absentia)
- 791 actual executions
- ~40,000 sentences of "national degradation" (loss of civil rights)

### Trials of Vichy Leaders

**Marshal Petain (July-August 1945):**
- Charged with treason and intelligence with the enemy
- Defended on grounds he had "protected" France
- Sentenced to death
- De Gaulle commuted sentence to life imprisonment due to age and WWI service
- Died in prison on Ile d'Yeu, 1951, aged 95

**Pierre Laval (October 1945):**
- Attempted suicide before execution
- Revived and executed by firing squad
- Last words reportedly: "Vive la France!"

**Joseph Darnand (October 1945):**
- Head of Milice executed for treason

**Other trials:**
- Fernand de Brinon: Executed 1947
- Xavier Vallat: 10 years imprisonment
- Rene Bousquet: Acquitted 1949 with "national degradation"; later indicted for crimes against humanity (1991), assassinated 1993 before trial
- Maurice Papon: Convicted 1998 (crimes against humanity); 10 years imprisonment
- Paul Touvier: Convicted 1994 (crimes against humanity); life imprisonment

### Memory and Recognition

**The "Gaullist myth":**
- Post-war narrative emphasized Resistance
- France portrayed as nation of resisters with few collaborators
- Vichy seen as unrepresentative "parenthesis"
- This view dominated for decades

**The Paxtonian revolution (1970s onward):**
- Robert Paxton's *Vichy France* (1972) fundamentally challenged the myth
- Demonstrated willing collaboration, not reluctant accommodation
- French translation (1973) sparked fierce debate
- Eventually became the accepted interpretation

**Official recognition:**
- **July 16, 1995**: President Jacques Chirac first acknowledged French state's responsibility for deportation of Jews
- Broke with previous position that Vichy was not legitimate France
- Subsequent presidents have reaffirmed this acknowledgment

> [!quote] President Jacques Chirac (1995)
> "These dark hours forever sully our history and are an insult to our past and our traditions. Yes, the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French State."

## Scholarly Debates

### Collaboration vs. Resistance

**The traditional "shield" thesis:**
- Petain protected France from worse fate
- Collaboration bought time and reduced suffering
- Most French were resistant "in spirit"

**Paxton's revision:**
- Collaboration was actively sought, not reluctantly imposed
- Vichy anticipated and exceeded German demands
- Antisemitic legislation was French initiative
- The shield thesis was self-serving myth

**Current synthesis:**
- Most French neither actively collaborated nor actively resisted
- "Attentisme" (wait and see) was most common response
- Approximately 2% actively resisted; ~1% actively collaborated
- Ordinary people navigated difficult circumstances with varying degrees of accommodation and resistance

### Petain's Personal Role

**Questions debated:**
- How much did Petain understand as his mental faculties declined?
- Did he genuinely believe he was protecting France?
- What was his personal role in antisemitic policies?
- Did he attempt to moderate or did he enable?

**Evidence suggests:**
- Petain approved antisemitic legislation personally
- He met with Hitler and publicly embraced collaboration
- His popularity provided crucial legitimacy to the regime
- By 1942, he was increasingly a figurehead while Laval governed

### Was Vichy Fascist?

**Arguments for fascist classification:**
- Authoritarian single leader
- Rejection of democracy
- Corporatism
- Antisemitism
- Cult of personality
- Historian Zeev Sternhell argued Vichy was "no less fascist than Mussolini's Italy"

**Arguments against:**
- No mass mobilizing party
- Traditional conservative more than revolutionary
- Looked backward to idealized past, not forward to new order
- Lacked dynamism of German or Italian fascism
- More Catholic-traditionalist than fascist

**Consensus view:**
- Vichy was authoritarian but not fully fascist
- It shared features with fascism but lacked others
- Best described as "reactionary authoritarian" regime
- Elements of fascism present, especially in Milice

- [[italy-mussolini]] — relationship: thematic (collaboration, fascist elements)
- [[spain-franco]] — relationship: thematic (authoritarian, Catholic-traditionalist)
- [[portugal-salazar]] — relationship: thematic (authoritarian, corporatist)
- [[romania-antonescu]] — relationship: temporal (Axis collaborator, Holocaust participation)

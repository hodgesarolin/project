## Pre-Conditions

### Meiji Restoration Legacy (1868)
- Accelerated industrialization; Japan became military power by 1895
- Slogan: "Enrich the country, strengthen the military" (fukoku kyohei)
- 1882 imperial rescript established military's privileged relationship with emperor
- Emperor brought to national prominence; Shinto replaced Buddhism

### 1920s Problems
- Deaths of Meiji-era elder statesmen left power vacuum
- Great Depression devastated rural areas; young soldiers from impoverished farms
- Western tariffs limited exports; discriminatory barriers to emigration
- Population pressure (~65 million in 1930) justified expansion for resources

### Rise of Ultranationalism
- Western rebuffs fed ultranationalist sentiment
- Discrimination against Asians fueled militarism
- Leaders felt other powers did not regard Japan as equals

### Military's Political Influence
- Meiji Constitution gave military direct access to emperor, bypassing civilian oversight
- Army and Navy could veto cabinet by refusing service minister nominations
- Two factions: Kodoha (Imperial Way) vs. Toseiha (Control Faction)

### Emperor's Divine Status
- Positioned as living god (arahitogami) within State Shinto
- Kokutai (national essence) placed emperor at center of identity
- Criticism criminalized under Peace Preservation Law

## Scholarly Debate

### Emperor Hirohito's Responsibility

**Arguments for significant responsibility** (Herbert P. Bix):
- "Activist, dynamic, politically empowered emperor who played a central role"
- Three Alls Policy sanctioned by Hirohito
- Direct access to military decisions

**Arguments for limited responsibility**:
- Unable to play substantial role in government structure
- Personal inclination allegedly toward peace

**Why not prosecuted**: MacArthur feared chaos; Cold War strategic considerations

### Nanjing Death Toll
- Range: 40,000-300,000+
- Sources of disagreement: Burial records, geographic/temporal definitions, victim categories
- **Consensus**: 100,000-200,000

### Atomic Bomb Necessity

**Traditionalist view**: Saved lives by preventing invasion; Japan showed no signs of surrendering

**Revisionist view**: Japan ready to surrender; Soviet invasion may have been more decisive; racial prejudice played role

### Japan's Acknowledgment of Atrocities

**Apologies issued**: Numerous since 1950s; 1995 Murayama Statement

**Criticisms**: Often followed by contradictory actions (Yasukuni visits); 2007 Abe denied comfort women coercion; no full recognition like Germany

**Yasukuni Shrine**: Honors 2.5 million war dead including 14 Class A criminals; visits by officials anger China/South Korea

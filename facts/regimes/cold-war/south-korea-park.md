## Pre-Conditions

### The Korean War (1950-1953)
The Korean War left South Korea devastated:
- **Physical destruction**: Entire cities and infrastructure lay in ruins; millions were displaced
- **Poverty**: Per capita income in the early 1960s was lower than Haiti, Ethiopia, and Yemen
- **Population suffering**: Over 40% of the nation's population in absolute poverty
- **Malnutrition**: People scavenged for grass and bark to survive; many had growth stunted by malnutrition
- **Industrial collapse**: Most of South Korea's industrial facilities destroyed during the war
- **Life expectancy**: Little more than 50 years in the 1950s

### The Syngman Rhee Regime (1948-1960)
The First Republic under Syngman Rhee was corrupt and authoritarian:
- **Governance style**: Authoritarian but ineffective; unable to create stable political system or economic development
- **Economic policy**: Relied on U.S. aid and an overvalued currency rather than constructive development strategy
- **U.S. dependency**: American aid accounted for nearly 80% of government revenues at its peak
- **Corruption**: Liberal Party had no real ideology other than perpetuating Rhee's rule
- **Political manipulation**: Used bribery, electoral manipulation, and strong-armed tactics to maintain power
- **Slow growth**: Only about 4% annually (under 2% per capita given high birthrates)
- **American frustration**: U.S. officials called South Korea a "rat hole" that swallowed aid without progress

### The April Revolution (1960)
Popular uprising forced Rhee from power:
- **Trigger**: March 1960 elections widely seen as rigged; Rhee won with 100% of vote
- **Catalyst**: Discovery of body of a high school student killed by police during anti-election protests in Masan
- **Protests**: Mass student protests in Seoul violently suppressed; 186 people killed in two weeks
- **Outcome**: Rhee resigned April 26, 1960; fled to exile in Hawaii (where he died in 1965)
- **Significance**: First successful popular uprising against authoritarian rule in Korea

### The Second Republic (1960-1961)
Korea's brief democratic experiment:
- **Structure**: Parliamentary system with Prime Minister Chang Myon as head of government
- **Reforms**: President's power greatly reduced after Rhee's abuses; largely ceremonial role
- **Problems**: Bitter factionalism in ruling Democratic Party; implacable popular unrest
- **Economic crisis**: Heavy inflation; unemployment above 23%; rice prices increased 60% from December 1960 to April 1961
- **Duration**: Less than one year before military coup

---

## Rise to Power

### The May 16, 1961 Military Coup

**Background**:
Park Chung-hee, believing South Korea would not improve without radical change, led a group of military officers to take over the government.

**The Coup Unfolds**:
- **Early morning, May 16**: Military units mobilized on key locations in Seoul north of the Han River
- **By 4:15 AM**: Forces had occupied the three branches of government with minimal resistance
- **Shortly after**: Took over Korean Broadcasting Company headquarters
- **Revolutionary manifesto**: Issued to the Korean public, their first glimpse at Park and the military government

**Immediate Aftermath**:
- The coup rendered powerless the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Chang Myon
- Dissolved the National Assembly
- Imposed martial law
- Formed the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction (SCNR)
- Nominally led by Army Chief of Staff Chang Do-young
- Park arrested General Chang in July 1961 and took direct control

**U.S. Response**:
President John F. Kennedy reluctantly accepted the coup to preserve the military alliance and prevent further instability.

### Transition to Civilian Rule (1963)

**Electoral Legitimization**:
- Under pressure from the United States, Park allowed presidential election in 1963
- Park narrowly defeated his opponent, gaining formal legitimacy
- Ushered in the Third Republic
- Government formally democratic but limited dissent and participation
- Park served as chairman of military junta for two years before becoming president

---

## Methods of Control

### The KCIA (Korean Central Intelligence Agency)

**Establishment**:
- Created June 19, 1961 by the military council
- Purpose: Prevent counter-coups and suppress potential enemies, foreign and domestic
- Founded by Kim Jong-pil, Korean Military Academy graduate and nephew of Park by marriage
- Kim credited with masterminding the 1961 coup
- Initial membership: 3,000 strong, drawn largely from Korean Counterintelligence Corps
- At peak: Estimated 30,000 KCIA agents

**Powers and Methods**:
- Virtually unlimited and completely unchecked power to arrest and detain any person on any charge
- Created climate of extreme fear and repression
- Frequent detention and torture of students, dissidents, opposition figures, communists, reporters
- Wiretapping, arresting, and torturing without court order
- Behind-the-scenes political maneuvers to weaken opposition parties through bribing, blackmailing, threatening, or arresting lawmakers

**Financial Operations**:
- Raised funds through extortion and stock market manipulation
- Used funds to bribe companies, individuals, and foreign governments
- **Koreagate scandal (1976)**: KCIA funneled bribes through businessman Tongsun Park; 115 Members of U.S. Congress implicated

**Notable Operations**:
- **1967**: Fabricated a spy ring, imprisoning 34 citizens to solidify Park's rule
- **1968**: Kidnapped 17 Koreans living in West Germany, transported to Seoul for torture and charges under National Security Law
- **1973**: Kidnapping of Kim Dae-jung from Tokyo (see below)

### The Yushin Constitution (1972)

**The October Restoration (Self-Coup)**:
On October 17, 1972, Park dissolved the National Assembly, suspended the constitution, and declared martial law:
- Press, radio, and television subjected to censorship
- Speech significantly restricted
- Park called it "Yusin" (restoration) — Korean pronunciation of Japanese word "Ishin," referencing the Meiji Restoration

**Key Features of Yushin Constitution**:
- Transferred presidential election to electoral college (National Conference for Unification)
- Dramatically expanded president's powers
- Sweeping powers to rule by decree and suspend constitutional freedoms
- Presidential term increased from four to six years with no limits on re-election
- President could dissolve National Assembly at will
- President appointed one-third of National Assembly members, guaranteeing parliamentary majority
- Codified emergency powers, turning presidency into legal dictatorship

### Emergency Decrees

Under Article 53 of the Yushin Constitution, the President was given power to make emergency decrees:

**Emergency Decree No. 1 (January 1974)**:
- Outlawed all public remarks and statements opposing the Yushin Constitution

**Emergency Decree No. 2 (January 1974)**:
- Allowed violators of Decree No. 1 to be put into custody without arrest warrant
- Jail sentences up to 15 years
- Established Emergency Court-Martial for adjudication

**Emergency Decree No. 4 (April 3, 1974)**:
- Declared unlawful the National Democratic Youth and Student Federation
- Death or imprisonment sentences for anyone held to have "praised, encouraged or sympathized with" this organization

**Emergency Decree No. 7 (April 8, 1975)**:
- Simply shut down Korea University

**Emergency Decree No. 9 (May 13, 1975)**:
- Power to require expulsion of "culprits" from schools and companies
- Banned publication of information
- Power to close schools, companies, and other organizations
- Banned all campus demonstrations
- Prohibited published criticism and political meetings
- Enabled authorities to remove offenders from their jobs

**Later Ruling**:
Almost three years after a 2010 case, the Constitutional Court ruled the emergency decrees unconstitutional, setting stage for nullifying all past rulings made under them.

### Labor Suppression

**Government Policy**:
- From Park's time, military rulers regarded unions as inherently left-wing institutions
- Restrictions aimed at keeping workers from "communist" ideas for national security
- Largest corporations (e.g., Hyundai conglomerate) allowed no unions at all
- Government openly intervened to break strikes throughout 1960s and 1970s

**Methods**:
- Severe physical abuse of workers in detention
- Range of techniques violating fundamental human rights
- Long working hours, low wages, murderous workplace safety standards
- Strict repression of workers' rights

**Jeon Tae-il Case (1970)**:
- Jeon Tae-il was a sewing worker who documented systemic Labor Standards Act violations: excessive overtime, child labor, unsafe conditions
- Labor officials told him and colleagues they were "unpatriotic" for complaining
- On November 13, 1970, at age 22, Jeon self-immolated in protest, shouting "Enforce the Labor Standards Act!" and "We are not machines, we are humans!"
- Regime characterized his death as isolated suicide from personal hardship
- His self-immolation "smashed the wall of silence" imposed by the dictatorship
- Catalyst for South Korean labor movement
- In 2020, President Moon posthumously conferred highest Order of Civil Merit upon Jeon

### Political Repression

**Targeting of Opposition**:
- Cracked down on intellectuals, students, religious leaders, workers
- Justified actions by accusing targets of collaborating with Communists
- Dissidents followed and had tax records scrutinized
- Church meetings monitored by men who "never sing hymns, refuse the collection plate and frequently take pictures of worshipers"

**Kim Dae-jung Kidnapping (August 1973)**:
- Kim had nearly defeated Park in 1971 presidential election (45.3% vs 53.2%)
- On August 8, 1973, Kim abducted from Hotel Grand Palace in Tokyo by KCIA agents
- Drugged, moved to Osaka, then to Seoul
- Hands and feet tied with weights aboard boat — intended to drown him in Sea of Japan
- U.S. Ambassador Philip Habib interceded; Japanese patrol plane tracked kidnappers
- Kim returned to South Korea, placed under house arrest, banned from politics
- Imprisoned 1976 for anti-government manifesto; designated prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International
- In 2007, NIS admitted KCIA undertook kidnapping with at least tacit backing from Park
- Kim eventually became President (1998-2003) and won Nobel Peace Prize (2000)

## Economic Development

### The "Miracle on the Han River"

**Overview**:
Park's 18-year rule is closely associated with South Korea's transformation from an impoverished country into one of the world's most advanced economies. This period of rapid economic growth is known as the "Miracle on the Han River."

**Starting Point (1961)**:
- GDP per capita: $72-$100
- Extreme poverty: 66.9% of population (Gapminder Foundation)
- Exports: $41 million
- National savings: Essentially zero

**Economic Model**:
- **Developmental state**: State-led development with government intervention
- **Export-oriented industrialization**: Focus on labor-intensive light industrial products using cheap labor
- **Soviet-inspired planning**: Five-Year Plans beginning in 1962
- **First Five-Year Plan**: Declared Ulsan as "special industrial development zone"

**Key Institutions**:
- Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) — modeled on Japan's MITI
- Economic Planning Board (EPB)
- Government-corporate cooperation on expanding exports

### The Chaebols

**Formation**:
- Chaebols: Family companies supported by the state, similar to Japanese zaibatsu
- Examples: Hyundai, LG, Samsung
- State offered loans, tax breaks, and subsidies
- Chaebols focused on government-prioritized industries
- Worked to meet strict export targets set by state

**Role in Development**:
- According to George E. Ogle, ten chaebol families responsible for 60% of growth during this period
- Could mobilize massive resources for long-term projects
- Unlike American corporations, could invest in industries that wouldn't pay off for years

### Economic Achievements

**By 1979**:
- Per capita income: Over $1,000 (twenty-fold increase)
- Extreme poverty: Reduced to 11.2% (from 66.9%) — one of fastest poverty reductions in human history
- Exports: $1.06 billion by 1971; continued rapid growth
- Export growth: Average 30% annually (1962-1982) with peaks over 50%
- Exports as share of GDP: Rose from 1% in 1950s to 30%+ by late 1970s
- National savings: Close to 20% of GDP by 1970
- GDP growth: Averaged 7-10% annually for three decades

**Four Asian Tigers**:
Under Park's rule, South Korea became one of the Four Asian Tigers (alongside Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore), possessing one of the fastest growing national economies during the 1960s and 1970s.

### The Human Cost

**Labor Exploitation**:
- Unbelievably long working hours
- Low wages
- Murderous workplace safety standards
- Strict repression of workers' rights
- Rampant pollution and ecological devastation

**Public Recognition**:
A 2015 survey showed:
- 93.3% of Koreans credited Park for economic progress
- 74% recognized his political repression

## Fall / End

### Crisis of Late 1970s

**Growing Opposition**:
- By late 1970s, South Korea was racked by growing protests against Park's authoritarianism
- YH Trading incident catalyzed broader unrest
- Expulsion of Kim Young-sam from National Assembly sparked Busan-Masan Uprising

### Internal Regime Conflict

**Kim Jae-gyu vs. Cha Ji-cheol**:
- Intense rivalry between KCIA Director Kim Jae-gyu and Chief Bodyguard Cha Ji-cheol
- Cha's encroachment onto KCIA turf and public belittlement of Kim
- Cha, almost universally disliked yet feared, became Park's favorite and most trusted advisor

### The Assassination (October 26, 1979)

**The Dinner Meeting**:
- Park Chung-hee assassinated during dinner at KCIA safe house near Blue House (presidential compound) in Jongno District, Seoul
- First assassination of Korean head of state in 605 years (since King Gongmin of Goryeo)

**Immediate Cause**:
- During a meeting, Park criticized Kim Jae-gyu for neglecting to stop the Busan-Masan protests
- Park wanted Kim to suppress protests "even if it meant the deaths of thirty thousand people"
- Outraged, Kim drew his pistol

**The Killing**:
- Kim Jae-gyu shot Park in the chest and head; Park died almost immediately
- Also killed: Cha Ji-cheol (head of presidential security service), three bodyguards, presidential chauffeur
- Kim and five co-conspirators later executed (May 24, 1980)

**Controversy Over Motive**:
- Kim claimed assassination was act to restore democracy and halt Park's authoritarian drift
- Critics note Kim had used all KCIA's tools of repression (torture, unlawful imprisonment, murder) as director
- Some view him as patriot who ended 18-year dictatorship; others as traitor motivated by personal grievance
- Later revelations about Kim's relationship with democracy movement leaders prompted reevaluation

## Aftermath

### The Power Vacuum (1979-1980)

**Immediate Aftermath**:
- Park's successor, Choi Kyu-hah, had no real control over government
- Power vacuum created political and social instability
- Democracy movements previously suppressed under Park emerged

### Chun Doo-hwan's Rise

**December 12, 1979 Coup**:
- Chun Doo-hwan, chief of Defense Security Command, seized control of military

### The Gwangju Uprising (May 18-27, 1980)

**Background**:
- Many civilians unhappy with military presence
- On May 18, citizens of Gwangju organized protests against Chun's coup

**Violent Suppression**:
- Chun ordered immediate suppression with shock troops, armored tanks, helicopters
- Paratroopers — trained for guerrilla warfare against North Korea — smashed unarmed citizens with clubs and rifle butts, stabbed with bayonets, stomped to death
- Worst violence on peninsula since Korean War

**Death Toll**:
- Nearly 250,000 people participated in rebellion
- Final death toll debated; most academic estimates place it at over 1,000 dead
- Became known as the "Gwangju Massacre"

**Significance**:
- Pivotal moment in South Korea's struggle for democracy
- Public outrage sowed seeds of Chun's eventual downfall
- Became symbol of struggle for freedom and human rights

### The Fifth Republic (1980-1987)

**Chun's Dictatorship**:
- Chun promulgated Constitution of Fifth Republic
- Replaced Yushin Constitution in 1980
- Continued authoritarian rule

**KCIA Purged**:
- Kim Jae-gyu and five others executed
- Agency temporarily lost much of its power
- Renamed to NIS (National Intelligence Service)

### The June Democratic Struggle (1987)

**Background**:
- Student activism widespread; 469,000 students participating in protests in 1985
- January 1987: Death of student activist Park Jong-chul under police torture sparked nationwide protests
- Student Lee Han-yeol fatally wounded by tear gas during demonstrations

**The Uprising**:
- Mass protests June 10-29, 1987
- Triggered by Chun's announcement of Roh Tae-woo as next president without direct elections
- Nearly four decades of authoritarian dictatorship culminated in this movement

**June 29 Declaration**:

- December 16, 1987: First direct presidential election since Park era
- Roh Tae-woo won with 36.6% (Kim Young-sam 28%, Kim Dae-jung 27%)
- Established current democratic system

### Democratic Consolidation

**Presidential Succession**:
- Kim Young-sam (1993-1998): First civilian president since 1961 coup
- Kim Dae-jung (1998-2003): First opposition candidate to win presidency

**Accountability for Gwangju**:
- 1995: Special Law on May 18 Democratization Movement enabled prosecution
- December 3, 1995: Chun, Roh Tae-woo, and 15 others arrested for conspiracy and insurrection
- Both former presidents sentenced to prison
- Both pardoned in 1997

## Scholarly Debate

### The "Development vs. Democracy" Tradeoff

**Pro-Development Arguments**:
- Transformed South Korea from one of world's poorest to one of most advanced economies
- One of fastest and largest reductions in poverty in human history
- Created foundation for chaebols that became global corporations
- Economic growth averaged 7-10% annually for three decades
- Model for other developing countries

**Critical Arguments**:
- "Miracle" only possible due to rampant exploitation of workers
- Long working hours, low wages, murderous workplace safety
- Political violence and surveillance pervasive
- Delayed development of democratic institutions by decades
- Economic development not clearly attributable to authoritarianism specifically

### The "Park Myth" Debate

**Questioning Conventional Narrative**:
- Recent scholarship challenges contrast between "predatory Rhee regime" and "developmental Park regime"
- Meritocracy in bureaucracy developed gradually over several decades, including under Rhee
- Some exogenous factors contributed to growth:
  - Japanese colonial legacies
  - Benevolent American hegemony
  - Successful land reform
  - Confucianism

**Colonial Legacies**:
- Foundations of Korean developmental state laid during Japanese occupation
- Park and other military leaders learned developmental model in 1930s Manchuria
- Connection to Park's own service in Japanese-controlled Manchukuo Imperial Army

### Ethical Questions

**Framing the Park Era**:
- Given widespread political violence and surveillance, framing regime as "success" carries significant ethical undertones
- Question of whether economic growth justifies human rights violations
- Park turned "comparatively restrained authoritarianism" of earlier phase into "something close to private estate of an autocrat" in Yushin phase

### Legacy Controversy

**Ongoing Divisions**:
- Park Chung Hee remains most controversial figure in modern Korean history
- Eighteen-year era considered one of most controversial topics for Korean public, politicians, and scholars
- Opinion split between those who credit Park for reforms and those who condemn authoritarian rule

**Survey Data (2015)**:
- 93.3% of Koreans credited Park for economic progress
- 74% recognized his political repression
- Demonstrates simultaneous acknowledgment of both economic achievement and authoritarianism

## Confidence Assessment
**Overall**: Moderate-High

**Notes**:
- Basic facts about regime well-documented through multiple sources
- Coup timeline, Yushin Constitution, and assassination well-established
- Economic data available from international institutions and Korean government
- Kim Dae-jung kidnapping confirmed by NIS internal inquiry (2007)
- People's Revolutionary Party cases overturned, fabrication confirmed by courts
- Gwangju Uprising death toll remains debated (official vs. academic estimates differ significantly)

**Areas of Uncertainty**:
- Comprehensive death toll statistics for Park era not consolidated; range from hundreds to low thousands
- Exact extent of torture and political imprisonment not fully documented
- Park's personal knowledge of specific KCIA operations (e.g., Kim kidnapping) debated
- Relative contribution of Park's policies vs. exogenous factors to economic growth remains scholarly debate
- Kim Jae-gyu's true motivations (democracy vs. personal grievance) contested

**Methodological Notes**:
- Much documentation comes from post-democratization truth-finding efforts
- Some KCIA records destroyed or remain classified
- Survivor testimony and court records provide primary documentation for abuses
- Economic statistics well-documented by World Bank, IMF, and Korean government agencies

## Pre-Conditions

### Political Instability and Civil War
Paraguay suffered chronic political instability in the decades before Stroessner:
- **Chaco War (1932-1935)**: Devastating conflict with Bolivia killed ~40,000 Paraguayans and destabilized politics
- **1936 February Revolution**: Military coup following the war
- **Higinio Morínigo regime (1940-1948)**: Pro-Axis sympathies during WWII; brutal dictatorship
- **Civil War of 1947**: Short but bloody conflict; Colorado Party emerged victorious over Liberal-Communist coalition
- Over 20 years of crises severely eroded social and political stability

### Colorado Party Dominance
Following the 1947 civil war:
- Colorado Party became the sole legal political party
- Opposition parties banned or driven underground
- Liberals and leftists killed, imprisoned, or exiled
- Party developed extensive patronage networks
- However, internal Colorado factions competed violently for power

### Federico Chávez Government (1949-1954)
- President Federico Chávez attempted to consolidate personal control
- Tensions with the military over his plan to arm the National Police with heavy weaponry
- Internal Colorado Party rivalries created opportunities for military intervention
- Epifanio Méndez Fleitas (Central Bank Director) fired, became Stroessner's co-conspirator

### Stroessner's Military Rise
- Stroessner rapidly rose through army ranks
- Played active role suppressing leftists in 1947 Civil War

- By 1951, appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces
- Cultivated relationships with both military officers and Colorado Party factions

---

## Rise to Power

### The May 4, 1954 Coup

**Background**:
In early 1954, the recently fired Central Bank Director Epifanio Méndez Fleitas joined forces with General Alfredo Stroessner in a plot to oust President Federico Chávez. The immediate trigger was Chávez's decision to outfit the National Police with heavy weaponry, which the Army viewed as a threat to its institutional power.

**Timeline**:
- **8:00 PM, May 4, 1954**: Coup began with attack on police headquarters in Asunción
- Elite Battalion 40 commandos led by Mario Ortega stormed police headquarters
- Young police chief Roberto Pettit was shot and killed during assault
- President Chávez sought refuge at Francisco López Military College
- College director Marcial Samaniego (Stroessner's friend) arrested Chávez instead of protecting him
- **Approximately 25 people killed** during the putsch

**Aftermath**:
- National Assembly appointed Tomás Romero Pereira as provisional president
- Special elections called for July 1954
- Colorado Party (only legal party) nominated Stroessner as presidential candidate
- In rigged July 1954 election, Stroessner won 98% running virtually unopposed
- **August 15, 1954**: Stroessner inaugurated as President

### Consolidation of Power
When Stroessner took office on August 15, 1954, "few imagined that this circumspect, unassuming forty-one-year-old would be a master politician capable of outmaneuvering and outlasting them all."

Immediately upon taking office:
- Declared state of siege (renewed every 90 days until 1987)
- Suspended constitutional freedoms including habeas corpus and freedom of assembly
- Purged potential rivals from military and party
- Established personal control over "the trilogy": government, Colorado Party, and armed forces
- Within two years, exiled co-conspirator Méndez Fleitas when he became a rival

---

## Methods of Control

### The State of Siege
- Declared immediately upon taking office in 1954
- Renewed every 90 days for over 32 years (until 1987)
- Only brief suspension: 24-hour period on election days
- Empowered government to arrest and detain anyone indefinitely without trial
- Forbidden: public meetings, demonstrations, political organizing
- After 1970, technically applied only to Asunción, but courts ruled anyone charged with security offenses could be brought to capital
- Stroessner ruled under effective martial law for nearly his entire tenure

### The Colorado Party — Vertical Control Structure
The regime "was not a classic military regime by any means," but rather centered on the Colorado Party:
- Party effectively replaced the state itself
- Vertical power structure based on "seccionales" (party branches) throughout country
- Seccionales provided social services in exchange for loyalty
- Party membership required for government jobs, professional licenses, business permits
- Network of informants embedded at all levels of society
- Party militias (including former Guión Rojo members) used for political violence

### Secret Police Apparatus

**Ministry of Interior**:
Under Ministers Edgar Ynsfrán (1956-1966) and Sabino Augusto Montanaro (1966-1989), two specialized repression units operated:

**DIPC (Departamento de Investigaciones de la Policía de la Capital)**:
- Led by Pastor Coronel
- Main center of Stroessner's repression apparatus
- Conducted surveillance, arrests, interrogations
- Pastor Coronel became one of most feared torturers

**DNAT (Dirección Nacional de Asuntos Técnicos) — "La Técnica"**:
- Created soon after Stroessner's rise to power
- Directed by Antonio Campos Alum
- Counter-insurgency intelligence unit
- Prime location for torture of political detainees
- Established extensive network of police informers throughout Paraguay and Argentina
- The U.S. Army officer Lieutenant Colonel Robert Thierry helped build the detention/interrogation center as part of Operation Condor
- Building now houses Museo de las Memorias: Dictadura y Derechos Humanos (Museum of Memory)

### Preventive Repression Strategy
The regime employed what General Gerardo Johansen publicly revealed at a 1972 Inter-American Defense Board meeting as "preventive repression":
- Surveillance of entire population through informant networks
- Preemptive arrest of potential dissidents before they could organize
- Secret police files include reports on innocuous family gatherings, license plates of parked cars, logs of everyone entering or leaving country at border posts, lists of guests at opposition weddings or wakes
- Some 20,000 civilians arbitrarily arrested during the Stroessner dictatorship
- 94% of those arrested were tortured as part of regime's "preventive repression"

### Torture Methods
Torture became routine state policy. Methods documented by Truth Commission and survivors include:
- **Electric shock**: Applied to genitals, lips, and sensitive areas
- **La Parrilla**: Naked victims strapped to metal bed frame for electrocution
- **Pileta**: Forced submersion and near-drowning
- **Severe beatings**: Systematic physical assault
- **Nail extraction**: Jailers severed nails from victims
- **Mutilation**: Documented cases of cutting off ears and tongues
- **Sexual violence**: Rape, sexual humiliation
- **Psychological torture**: Mock executions, threats to family members, forcing victims to witness torture of others
- **Standing cells**: Wooden closet-like structures for prolonged standing isolation

Among the most feared torturers were Pastor Coronel, Antonio Campos Alum, and Ramón Aquino.

### Press Suppression
- Constitutional guarantees notwithstanding, press freedom was eliminated
- Any criticism of government or Colorado Party resulted in destruction of media outlets
- Many media executives sent to prison or tortured
- Opposition publications systematically closed

### Disposal of Bodies
Following executions:
- Bodies dumped in the Chaco (remote western region)
- Bodies thrown into the Río Paraguay
- Victims "disappeared" with no information given to families

---

## Key Events & Atrocities

### Operation Condor Participation

**Paraguay as a Founding Pillar**:
Paraguay under Stroessner was not a bystander but a central pillar of Operation Condor:
- Coordinated intelligence with Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay
- Traded prisoners between participating dictatorships
- Hosted logistics of cross-border repression
- Archives of Terror documents prove systematic Paraguayan participation

**1975 Santiago Meeting**:
A letter written by Manuel Contreras, head of Chilean DINA, invited Paraguayan intelligence officials to Santiago for the "First Working Meeting on National Intelligence" on November 25, 1975. This letter placed intelligence chiefs from Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay at the meetings, solidifying the formation of Operation Condor.

**Case of Martín Almada**:
Educator Martín Almada's testimony documents the international nature of the repression:
- Arrested November 1974
- Held by multi-country military "tribunal" of Argentine, Brazilian, Chilean, Uruguayan, and Paraguayan officers
- Tortured for 30 days
- His police file documents jailers severing nails, cutting off ears and tongues, beating him until he was forced to sign confession under threat of death
- His wife Celestina Pérez died under torture
- Later discovered the Archives of Terror while searching for evidence of his own torture

### Indigenous Persecution — The Aché Genocide

**Background**:
Between 1956 and 1989, the indigenous population had more territory taken than at any other period in Paraguay's history and were subjected to systematic human rights abuses.

**The Aché People**:
During the 1960s and 1970s, approximately 85% of the Aché tribe died:
- Many hacked to death with machetes to make room for timber industry, mining, farming, and ranchers
- Approximately 900 deaths estimated
- "Aché hunts" became commonplace, with settlers referring to them as "mountain rats"
- Dictatorship launched campaign of forced settlement to expel them from their lands
- Those who refused transfer were forcibly captured in military raids
- Many killed, captured, or forcibly displaced — a "veritable ethnic cleansing"

**Atrocities at Settlements**:
- Forced labor, particularly men on farms
- Sale of indigenous children to Paraguayan families
- Denial of food and medicine
- Torture, enslavement, and murder

**Perpetrators**:
- Manuel Jesús Pereira: Most notorious hunter of the Aché
- Local landowner and employee of Paraguay's Native Affairs Department
- His farm was turned into an Aché "reservation"

**International Recognition**:
- 1971: German anthropologist Mark Münzel accused Stroessner of attempted genocide
- 1973: Münzel's report "The Aché Indians: Genocide in Paraguay" published by IWGIA
- Jesuit anthropologist Bartomeu Melià called forced relocations "ethnocide"
- Reports covered by Washington Post and New York Times
- **Whitaker Report of the United Nations** listed persecution of the Aché as an example of genocide
- Case brought before Inter-American Human Rights Commission
- Commission gave provisional ruling Paraguay had not carried out genocide, but expressed concerns
- National Aché Federation later launched court case in Argentina using universal jurisdiction

**Government Response**:
- British, U.S., and West German governments denied genocide was taking place
- U.S. aid totaling $146 million from 1962-1975 financed repressive actions

### Harboring Nazi War Criminals

**Policy**:
Stroessner made Paraguay a refuge for Nazi war criminals among 200,000 Germans he sheltered after World War II. Foreign press referred to his government as the "poor man's Nazi regime" given his affinity for Nazism.

**Josef Mengele**:
- The "Angel of Death" of Auschwitz acquired Paraguayan citizenship under his own name
- Protected by Stroessner government
- Stroessner's family originated in same Bavarian town as Mengele
- 1962: West Germany requested extradition; Stroessner refused
- 1964: West German ambassador again requested extradition; Stroessner angrily refused and would not strip citizenship: "Once a Paraguayan, always a Paraguayan"
- 1979: Citizenship finally revoked under international pressure
- Mengele had fled to Brazil around 1960; died there in 1979

**Other Nazis**:
- Eduard Roschmann ("the Butcher of Riga"): Fled to Asunción from Argentina in 1977; died peacefully in Paraguay

### LGBTQ+ Persecution
Scapegoating, detention, and torture of LGBTQ+ Paraguayans occurred frequently throughout the Stroessner period.

---

## Economic Policies and Corruption

### IMF-Influenced Policies
Stroessner demanded the business sector adopt an economic program recommended by the International Monetary Fund:
- Price stabilization measures
- Currency controls
- Attracted foreign investment and loans

### The Itaipu Dam Boom

**Construction**:
- Joint venture with Brazil, world's largest hydroelectric project at the time
- Brazil provided financing in exchange for most of the power produced
- Construction created enormous employment for Paraguayans
- Responsible for 10%+ growth rates making Paraguay a continental leader in late 1970s
- 11% GDP growth in 1980

**Surveillance and Repression**:
Formerly classified documents show how Itaipu Dam participated in the Stroessner regime's secret police terror apparatus:
- Dam used in security and intelligence apparatus
- Violently suppressed any opposition among workers
- Surveillance extended to dam construction workforce

### Economic Decline
By mid-1980s, the regime faced serious economic difficulties:
- Completion of Itaipu dam ended the construction boom
- Loss of numerous jobs
- Exposure to broader Latin American debt crisis
- Reduced patronage resources heightened competition among factions
- GDP shrank 10% in 1983

### Systemic Corruption

**"The Trilogy" Corruption Network**:
The regime was characterized by corruption and distribution of favors among "the trilogy": government, Colorado Party, and armed forces:
- Most businesspeople showing allegiance to regime operated unrestricted with complete impunity
- Activities outside power group's control were repressed
- Public investment projects rife with diverted and misused funds

**Smuggling Franchises**:
According to Aldo Zuccolillo (wealthy businessman and former Stroessner associate):
- Stroessner parceled out smuggling franchises to senior military and Colorado Party officials
- "One general gets the profits from smuggling flour from Argentina, another is in charge of smuggling electronic equipment to Brazil, and so on"
- "Smuggling is the price of peace"

**Ciudad Presidente Stroessner** (now Ciudad del Este):
- Named after the dictator
- Became South America's leader in contraband activities
- A "smuggler's paradise"
- Economy depended to "astonishing degree" on smuggling and officially-sanctioned corruption

**Military Enrichment**:
Armed forces were under Stroessner's complete control, permitted to enrich themselves through illicit activities including prostitution and drugs — provided they maintained loyalty.

### Land Distribution
According to Oxfam:
- 1.6% of population owns 80% of the land as direct consequence of Stroessner regime
- Between 1954-1989, approximately 8 million hectares (one-third of total arable land) distributed irregularly to people personally connected to Stroessner
- Truth Commission found 7,851,295 hectares irregularly awarded during Stroessner regime and 15 following years of transition — mostly to family members, political and military allies

---

## Opposition & Resistance

### Armed Opposition
Several guerrilla movements attempted to challenge the regime:
- Infiltration of armed movements was perfected by DNAT counter-insurgency unit
- Movements systematically penetrated and destroyed
- Extensive network of police informers established throughout country and in Argentina

### Indigenous Resistance
Paraguayan indigenous peoples resisted the Stroessner regime from 1969-1989:
- Nonviolent resistance to forced relocations
- International advocacy through anthropologists and missionaries
- Cases brought to international human rights bodies

### International Criticism
- Amnesty International and other human rights organizations documented abuses
- UN bodies expressed concern
- Some academic and journalistic exposure

### Internal Divisions (1980s)
In the late 1980s, political conflict emerged between two competing factions in Colorado Party:
- **"Militants"**: Vigorously supported Stroessner; wanted Gustavo Stroessner to succeed his father
- **"Traditionalists"**: Sought more open Paraguay; less supportive of some policies

General Andrés Rodríguez was among the traditionalists — setting stage for 1989 coup.

---

## Fall / End

### Causes of the 1989 Coup

**Succession Crisis**:
The 76-year-old Stroessner, recovering from recent health issues including surgery, increasingly favored his son Gustavo for greater influence. Gustavo directed the secret police but lacked broad military support. Senior officers viewed him as an unqualified civilian interloper.

**Rodríguez's Position Threatened**:
General Andrés Rodríguez, Stroessner's long-time protégé and commander of the powerful First Army Corps, positioned himself as the logical heir but faced demotion risks. The militant faction attempted to neutralize his power by offering him the position of defense minister (largely ceremonial) or retirement.

**Economic Strain**:
Completion of Itaipú project in mid-1980s ended construction boom, reducing patronage resources and heightening competition among factions.

**External Factors**:
- Cold War winding down reduced U.S. need for anti-communist allies
- Roman Catholic Church withdrew support
- United States no longer required Stroessner as ally

### The February 1989 Coup (La Noche de la Candelaria)

**Timeline**:
- **February 2-3, 1989**: Coup began
- Street fighting resulted in numerous soldiers killed
- Within hours, all country's military districts defected to rebels
- Stroessner resigned only 17 hours after hostilities began

**Results**:
- Rodríguez's takeover ended El Stronato: 34+ years of dictatorship
- Led to array of reforms abolishing numerous draconian laws
- Liberalization of Paraguay began

### Exile and Death

**Exile in Brazil**:
- Stroessner fled to Brazil; granted asylum
- Lived peacefully in fashionable neighborhood along Lake Paranoa in Brasília
- Tried to return to Paraguay before death; rebuked and threatened with arrest
- Became international pariah

**Legal Proceedings**:
- At time of death, defendant in several human rights cases in Paraguay
- 2003: Arrest warrant issued for role in 1974 death of Celestina Pérez (Martín Almada's wife)

**Death**:
- **August 16, 2006**: Died in exile in Brasília at age 93
- Had spent several days in intensive care with pneumonia after hernia operation
- Weighed just 45 kg at death
- Died of stroke
- Paraguayan government announced it would not receive body with honors

---

## Aftermath

### Immediate Transition

**Rodríguez Presidency (1989-1993)**:
- Rodríguez initiated controlled transition including partial media liberalization
- Released political prisoners
- Colorado Party retained control over military and bureaucracy
- May 1, 1989: First multiparty elections in decades (Rodríguez won as Colorado candidate)
- Established precedent for future elections
- Facilitated development of new constitution

**1992 Constitution**:
- Took effect June 20, 1992
- Provided foundation for democratic Paraguay
- Included habeas data provisions allowing citizens to access information about themselves held by state

### Discovery of the Archives of Terror (1992)

**The Discovery**:
- **December 22, 1992**: Lawyer and human-rights activist Dr. Martín Almada and Judge José Agustín Fernández discovered archives in police station in Lambaré suburb of Asunción
- Almada had been searching for years for documents proving his own torture
- Contacted by woman with information about possible evidence
- Found almost two tons (later estimated at three tons) of documents

**Contents**:
The "terror archives" documented:
- 50,000 people murdered
- 30,000 people disappeared
- 400,000 people imprisoned
- Secret establishment of Operation Condor network in 1975
- Joint information center at headquarters of Chilean secret police in Santiago
- General Stroessner's personal involvement in Operation Condor
- Criminal records, statements from captured individuals, prisoner control books, intelligence reports, police photographs, materials from raids

**Significance**:
- Collection occupies approximately 300 linear meters
- First repository of Operation Condor documentation discovered in Latin America
- Used to prosecute former military officers in multiple countries
- Much of case against Pinochet by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón made using these archives
- March 1993: Supreme Court created Archive and Documentation Center for the Defense of Human Rights
- Center is open to public; approximately 60,000 records available for consultation on 300,000 documents
- Designated UNESCO Memory of the World

### Truth and Justice Commission (CVJ)

**Establishment and Operation**:
- Established by act of parliament October 2003
- Operated June 2004 - August 2008 (4 years, 2 months)
- Budget cut by half by parliament, creating resource problems

**Findings** (Final Report released August 28, 2008):
Based on 2,059 testimonies, 14,000 documents, and 8 public hearings:
- **128,077 persons** (almost 1% of population) were potential victims
- **20,090** directly affected by human rights abuses
- **19,682** political prisoners
- **18,772** torture victims
- **3,470** exiles
- **377** disappearances
- **59** extrajudicial executions

**Findings on Stroessner**:
- April 2006: Commission announced Stroessner was responsible for 60 cases of human rights violations
- Civil society criticized this number as far too low

**Secret Torture Chamber Discovery**:
Two months after final report release, a soldier testified revealing existence of secret torture chamber in basement of former Ministry of Interior — where political prisoners from Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay were detained as part of Operation Condor.

**Recommendations**:
- Continue search for disappeared individuals
- Establish center for public information
- Create genetics database
- Include findings in public school curriculum
- Investigate estimated 2,800 individuals who allegedly committed abuses

### Reparations
- Government initiated reparations program managed by National Commission on Human Rights
- Approximately 400 individuals have received financial compensation
- Total approximately $20 million USD

### Prosecutions
- Some collaborators put on trial after regime fell (Pastor Coronel, José Eugenio Jacquet)
- Efforts to prosecute Stroessner failed; died in exile
- Limited accountability overall

### Democratic Transition — Limited Success

**Formal Achievements**:
- Expansion of civil and political liberties
- Elections at presidential, congressional, and municipal levels
- First fully competitive election 1993 (Juan Carlos Wasmosy elected)
- Eight competitive presidential elections since 1989

**Persistent Problems**:
The democratization process has been limited:
- Colorado Party retains power through clientelist practices
- Widespread corruption
- Elite rule continues
- Institutional fragility
- Party membership still required for many jobs
- Civil society remains weak after decades of "preventive repression"
- Senior political figures linked to organized crime
- Smuggling and drug trafficking flourish

**Colorado Party Dominance**:
- Ruled almost continuously since 1989
- Interrupted only by single term 2008-2013 (Fernando Lugo)
- Won 8 of 9 national elections since fall of dictatorship

---

## Scholarly Debate

### Nature of the Regime
Scholars debate how to categorize the Stroessner dictatorship:
- **Paul H. Lewis** (*Paraguay Under Stroessner*, 1980): Emphasized Stroessner's skill at co-opting elites and rallying nationalist rhetoric; noted 1954-1963 was "the most repressive" period Paraguay had known; focused on regime survival and U.S.-Paraguay alliance
- **René D. Harder Horst** (*The Stroessner Regime and Indigenous Resistance in Paraguay*): Foregrounds experiences of victims; tries to "see the dictatorship through Indian eyes"; "nuanced contribution"
- Later scholars emphasize systematic brutality and place Stroessner in wider context of Operation Condor state terror

### U.S.-Paraguay Relations
- **Kirk Tyvela** (*The Dictator Dilemma*): Stroessner's dictatorship "enjoyed the backing of successive U.S. governments who valued his staunch anticommunism" for majority of its duration; emphasizes symbolic importance of U.S. relations
- $146 million in U.S. aid 1962-1975 financed repressive apparatus
- U.S. Army officer helped construct La Técnica torture center

### Economic Legacy Debate
- Period of high growth during Itaipu construction (10%+ annually late 1970s)
- Growth fueled by smuggling and dam construction rather than sound economic policy
- Economic collapse after dam completion exposed vulnerability
- Extreme land inequality persists as direct legacy

### Indigenous Persecution
- Debate over whether treatment of Aché constituted genocide or "only" ethnocide
- UN Whitaker Report listed it as example of genocide
- Inter-American Commission gave provisional ruling of no genocide but expressed concerns
- Ongoing legal cases in Argentina using universal jurisdiction

### Paraguay's "Atypical" Transition
Latin American scholars note Paraguay's transition is unusual:
- Authoritarian regimes typically succeeded by new parties contending for power
- Paraguay's Colorado Party retained control throughout transition and after
- "Hard to start with a clean slate" — old political patterns too entrenched
- Questions whether genuine democratization has occurred

## Comparisons
- [[chile-pinochet]] — relationship: temporal (Operation Condor partner; similar methods; torture center cooperation)
- [[argentina-junta]] — relationship: temporal (Operation Condor partner; shared prisoners and intelligence)
- [[brazil-military]] — relationship: temporal (Operation Condor partner; shared border and intelligence cooperation)
- [[uruguay-dictatorship]] — relationship: temporal (Operation Condor partner; coordinated repression)

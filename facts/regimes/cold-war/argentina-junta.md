# Argentina - National Reorganization Process (1976-1983)

## Overview
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Country/Region** | Argentina |
| **Dates** | March 24, 1976 - December 10, 1983 |
| **Leader(s)** | Jorge Rafael Videla (1976-1981), Roberto Viola (1981), Leopoldo Galtieri (1981-1982), Reynaldo Bignone (1982-1983) |
| **Type** | Military junta (bureaucratic-authoritarian) |
| **Duration** | 7 years, 8 months |
| **Estimated Death Toll** | 9,000 (official CONADEP) to 30,000 (human rights organizations) |

## Classification

The *Proceso de Reorganizacion Nacional* (National Reorganization Process) was a bureaucratic-authoritarian military dictatorship characterized by:

- Rule by a three-member military junta representing Army, Navy, and Air Force
- Systematic state terrorism as official policy
- Complete suspension of democratic institutions (Congress dissolved, political parties banned)
- Elimination of civil liberties and due process
- Clandestine repression through an organized network of detention centers

The regime explicitly defined itself as a "reorganization" of Argentine society, targeting not just armed insurgents but broad sectors of civil society deemed "subversive."

## Pre-Conditions

### Political Instability
- **Death of Juan Peron** (July 1, 1974): Left his third wife Isabel Peron as president, the first female head of state in the Western Hemisphere
- **Weak Government**: Isabel Peron lost congressional majority, popular support limited to right-wing Peronist faction
- **Extreme Polarization**: Radical left and right factions, with shifting support away from democratic institutions

### Left-Wing Guerrilla Groups

**Montoneros** (Peronist guerrillas):
- Estimated 300-400 active members in 1977; peaked at 2,000 in 1975
- Conducted bombings at corporate facilities
- Attributed with assassination of trade union leader Jose Ignacio Rucci (September 1973)
- Became increasingly isolated after 1973

**ERP (People's Revolutionary Army)**:
- Guevarist group inspired by Che Guevara's foco theory
- Began rural insurgency in Tucuman province (1975) with approximately 100 fighters
- Controlled approximately one-third of Tucuman territory at peak
- Defeated by Argentine Army in Operation Independence before the coup

### Right-Wing Death Squads

**AAA (Argentine Anticommunist Alliance / Triple A)**:
- Paramilitary death squad led by Social Welfare Minister Jose Lopez Rega
- CONADEP documented 458 assassinations from 1973-1975:
  - 1973: 19 deaths
  - 1974: 50 deaths
  - 1975: 359 deaths
- Targeted leftists including Peronist group members

## Rise to Power

### The Coup (March 24, 1976)

- **Planning**: The coup had been planned since October 1975; the Peron government learned of preparations two months before execution
- **U.S. Awareness**: Throughout 1975-1976, U.S. officials repeatedly warned Washington a coup was likely due to crime, violence, and instability under Isabel Peron
- **Execution**: On March 24, 1976, the military arrested Isabel Peron and seized power

### Initial Junta Composition
The first military junta consisted of:
1. **Lt. General Jorge Rafael Videla** (Army) - became President
2. **Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera** (Navy)
3. **Brigadier-General Orlando Ramon Agosti** (Air Force)

### Immediate Actions
- Dissolved National Congress
- Imposed strict censorship
- Banned trade unions
- Brought state and municipal governments under military control
- Imposed free market and deregulation policies

## Methods of Control

### Propaganda/Media Control
- **Censorship Apparatus**: General Direction of Publications (Direccion General de Publicaciones) determined which books were "subversive"
- **Self-Censorship**: Journalists understood unwritten rules; publishing information about disappearances, detention camps, or economic consequences would result in closure
- **Banned Language**: Words like "disappeared" (desaparecido) were censored, erasing victims from public discourse
- **International Propaganda**: Hired American PR firm Burson-Marsteller to promote Argentina's image abroad, particularly for 1978 World Cup
- **Exile of Truth**: Only Argentine journalists living abroad published accurate reports on human rights violations

### Clandestine Detention Centers
- **CONADEP identified over 340 secret detention centers** throughout Argentina
- **ESMA (Navy Mechanics School)**: Most notorious facility in Buenos Aires
  - Outwardly functioned as naval mechanics school
  - Approximately 5,000 prisoners passed through
  - "Capucha" (hood room) where detainees were kept blindfolded for weeks
  - Site of torture, interrogation, and execution

### Forced Disappearances (Desaparecidos)
- **Methodology**:
  - Victims seized from homes, often at night
  - No due process or legal proceedings
  - No acknowledgment of detention
  - Families left with no information
- **Scale**: CONADEP documented 8,961 cases; actual number estimated much higher

### Death Flights (Vuelos de la Muerte)
- **Method**:
  - Victims told they were being transferred and would be freed
  - Injected with sodium pentothal (sedative)
  - Stripped naked and thrown from aircraft into Rio de la Plata or Atlantic Ocean
- **Scale**: Naval officer Adolfo Scilingo testified to 180-200 flights during 1977-1978
  - Flights conducted "every Wednesday for two years"
  - Estimated 1,500-2,000 killed by this method
- **Aircraft**: British-made Skyvan aircraft; one plane recovered and now displayed at ESMA memorial

### Torture
- Electric shocks
- Beatings
- Sexual violence
- Psychological torture
- Prolonged detention in inhumane conditions

### Operation Condor Coordination
Argentina served as the **operational center** for Operation Condor (1975-1983):
- **Members**: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil (1976), Peru and Ecuador (1978)
- **Headquarters**: Condoreje (operational axis) based in Buenos Aires
- **Purpose**: Transnational network to locate, monitor, kidnap, torture, and assassinate exiled dissidents
- **Argentina's Code**: #1 in Condortel communication system
- **Impact**: 70% of Condor operations took place in Argentina
- **Victims**: At least 805 confirmed victims of transnational repression (1969-1981)

### Economic Policies
- **Economy Minister**: Jose Alfredo Martinez de Hoz
- **Policies**: Free market reforms, deregulation, economic liberalization
- **Results**: Massive unemployment, soaring foreign debt, inflation

## Key Policies & Events

### The "Dirty War" (Guerra Sucia)
- Campaign waged 1976-1983 against suspected left-wing political opponents
- Characterized by systematic state terror, extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances
- Targeted: suspected guerrillas, trade unionists, students, journalists, intellectuals, political activists, and their families
- Anyone deemed "subversive" could be targeted regardless of actual political activity

### 1978 World Cup
- **Propaganda Value**: Junta prioritized World Cup organization to mask atrocities
- **Burson-Marsteller Campaign**: $1 million retainer to promote "stability" and "new image"
- **Opening**: Videla inaugurated the "World Cup for Peace" at Monumental Stadium (June 1)
- **Proximity to Terror**: Stadium noise reached ESMA detention center one mile away; torturers watched games with prisoners
- **Controversial Final**: Argentina defeated Peru 6-0 to advance
  - Reports of 35,000 tons of grain shipped to Peru beforehand
  - $50 million in frozen Peruvian assets released
  - Videla and Henry Kissinger allegedly visited Peruvian locker room before match
- **Argentina's Victory**: Won World Cup, defeating Netherlands in final
  - Dutch players refused to collect second-place medals (reportedly to avoid shaking dictator's hand)
- **International Boycott**: French COBA campaign under slogan "No football in the concentration camps"
- **Player Perspective**: Osvaldo Ardiles later said "It hurts to know that we were a distraction... We were used as propaganda by the military"

### Stolen Babies (Ninos Apropiados)
- **Scale**: Estimated 500 babies taken from detained mothers and given to military families or regime supporters
- **Method**:
  - Pregnant detainees kept alive until giving birth
  - Babies separated from mothers (sometimes within days)
  - Mothers then "disappeared"
  - False birth certificates issued
  - Waiting lists existed among military families seeking to adopt stolen children
- **Identified to Date**: 140 grandchildren identified (as of 2025)
- **Remaining**: Approximately 300 still unaccounted for

## Opposition & Resistance

### Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo
- **Founded**: April 1977
- **Method**: Weekly marches around Plaza de Mayo wearing white headscarves
- **Purpose**: Demanded information about disappeared children
- **Significance**: Became international symbol of resistance to dictatorship
- **Courage**: Continued demonstrations despite personal risk (some Mothers were themselves "disappeared")

### Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo
- **Founded**: 1977
- **Purpose**: Locate children stolen from political prisoners
- **Method**: Pioneered use of mitochondrial DNA testing (with geneticist Mary-Claire King) to identify stolen children
- **National Genetic Data Bank**: Established to store family samples for future identification
- **Success**: 140 grandchildren identified to date
- **Ongoing**: Organization continues work; approximately 300 still missing

### International Pressure
- Foreign journalists reporting on abuses
- Human rights organizations (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch)
- Carter administration's human rights policy created friction
- International boycott campaigns (e.g., 1978 World Cup)

### Internal Dissent
- Limited due to extreme repression
- Most opposition figures killed, imprisoned, or exiled
- Some military figures (like U.S. Ambassador Robert C. Hill) privately opposed excesses

## Fall / End

### Falklands/Malvinas War (April-June 1982)

**Background**:
- By 1982, junta under Leopoldo Galtieri faced criticism for economic mismanagement and human rights abuses
- Decision to invade Falkland Islands was primarily political: to unite Argentines in patriotic fervor and distract from domestic problems

**The War**:
- **April 2, 1982**: Argentina invaded and occupied Falkland Islands
- **Initial Reaction**: Invasion was popular; anti-junta demonstrations replaced by patriotic rallies
- **Miscalculation**: Galtieri believed Britain would not respond militarily
- **British Response**: Full military task force deployed
- **June 14, 1982**: British forces recaptured Port Stanley; Argentine surrender

**Casualties**:
- 649 Argentine military personnel killed
- 255 British military personnel killed
- 3 Falkland Islanders killed

### Collapse of the Junta

- **June 17, 1982**: Galtieri resigned as president (three days after surrender)
- **July 1, 1982**: General Reynaldo Bignone installed as president
- **October 30, 1983**: Democratic elections held
- **December 10, 1983**: Democracy formally restored; President Raul Alfonsin sworn in

**Why the War Ended the Dictatorship**:
- Military defeat shattered regime's legitimacy
- Exposed incompetence of military leadership
- War had been gamble for survival; losing eliminated any remaining support
- Economic crisis continued unabated
- International isolation intensified

## Scholarly Debate

### Death Toll Controversy

**The 30,000 Figure**:
- Used by human rights organizations, Mothers and Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo
- Has symbolic and political significance
- Includes all victims (disappeared, tortured, illegally detained, stolen children)

**Lower Estimates (8,000-9,000)**:
- CONADEP documented 8,961 cases
- Videla himself admitted to approximately 8,000 killed
- Some political figures cite lower numbers to minimize crimes

**Middle Estimates (15,000-22,000)**:
- Argentine military intelligence (Battalion 601) estimated 22,000 by mid-1978
- Declassified Chilean documents corroborate higher figures

**Why the Debate Matters**:
- Denialism and relativization of crimes has resurged politically
- Numbers focus on documented fatal victims vs. total victimization
- Documentation challenges inherent to clandestine repression

### U.S. Complicity

**Evidence of Support**:
- Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told Argentine foreign minister (June 1976): "If there are things that have to be done, you should do them quickly"
- U.S. Ambassador Robert C. Hill reported this was interpreted as "green light" for state terrorism
- Assistant Secretary Harry Shlaudeman told Kissinger: "Security forces are totally out of control"
- Despite warnings, Kissinger maintained support

**Operation Condor Connection**:
- Ford administration offered counterinsurgency training, financial assistance, intelligence briefings
- CIA and State/Defense Departments "intimately aware" of Condor (per 1999 declassified documents)
- Argentina served as Condor operations center

**Post-Office Support**:
- After leaving government, Kissinger congratulated junta for "wiping out terrorism"
- Attended 1978 World Cup as Videla's guest

**Declassification**:
- 43,000 U.S. documents declassified following 2016 Obama-Macri agreement
- Documents include names of officials and informants, torture techniques
- May spur additional prosecutions

**Scholarly Assessment**:
- Patricia Derian (Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights under Carter): "I think he was complicit"
- Debate continues over extent of U.S. responsibility vs. Argentine agency

### Transitional Justice Model

**Argentina's Significance**:
- First Latin American country to prosecute former dictators
- CONADEP/Nunca Mas became model for truth commissions globally
- Demonstrated possibility of accountability after authoritarian rule
- Influenced Chile, Uruguay, Colombia and others

**Unique Aspects**:
- Extensive documentation (340+ detention centers mapped)
- Civilian-led truth commission
- Criminal prosecutions despite initial amnesties
- Ongoing process (trials continue 40+ years later)
- DNA identification program for stolen children

**Limitations**:
- Initial amnesty laws delayed justice
- Many perpetrators died before prosecution
- Some victims never identified
- Exact death toll remains contested

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall**: High

**Notes**:
- Argentina's Dirty War is exceptionally well-documented compared to many authoritarian regimes
- CONADEP report provides extensive primary source documentation
- U.S. declassified documents corroborate many claims
- Ongoing trials continue to produce new evidence
- Death toll remains contested, but range (9,000-30,000) is well-established

**Areas of Uncertainty**:
- Exact death toll within 9,000-30,000 range
- Complete list of all detention centers
- Full extent of U.S. knowledge and approval
- Identity of all perpetrators
- Fate of approximately 300 still-missing stolen children

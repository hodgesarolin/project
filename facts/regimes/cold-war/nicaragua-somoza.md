## Pre-Conditions

### U.S. Occupation and Its Legacy (1912-1933)
Nicaragua experienced intermittent U.S. military occupation from 1912 to 1933 during the "Banana Wars" era:
- Marines intervened repeatedly to protect U.S. business interests
- Occupation centralized state power in Managua
- Created the National Guard (Guardia Nacional) as combined military and police force
- National Guard trained by U.S. Marines to "safeguard U.S. interests"
- U.S. supervised elections in an attempt to establish stability

### The Sandino Rebellion (1927-1933)
Augusto Cesar Sandino led a guerrilla war against U.S. occupation:
- Sandino emerged as a symbol of Nicaraguan nationalism and anti-imperialism
- His forces fought the U.S. Marines to a stalemate
- Marines withdrew in 1933 after training the National Guard
- Sandino negotiated peace with President Juan Bautista Sacasa
- Sandino's opposition to the National Guard made him a target

### Political Instability
Prior to Somoza's rise, Nicaragua experienced:
- Chronic conflict between Liberal and Conservative factions
- Weak civilian institutions subordinate to military power
- Foreign economic domination (U.S. companies controlled key sectors)
- Deep inequality between landowning elite and peasant majority

### Somoza Garcia's Background
Anastasio Somoza Garcia positioned himself for power through:
- Son of a wealthy coffee planter family
- Education in Philadelphia, where he learned fluent English
- Marriage to Salvadora Debayle from a prominent Nicaraguan family
- Work as interpreter during U.S.-Nicaragua peace negotiations
- Cultivated relationships with U.S. officials, particularly Ambassador Matthew E. Hanna

---

## Rise to Power

### Appointment to National Guard (1933)
At the urging of U.S. Ambassador Matthew E. Hanna, Somoza Garcia was appointed as director of the National Guard in 1933:
- Despite limited military experience, his fluency in English and U.S. connections proved decisive
- The Marines had taken care to train the Guard to safeguard U.S. interests
- American pressure persuaded President Sacasa (Somoza's uncle-in-law) to give him command

### Assassination of Sandino (February 21, 1934)
After President Sacasa completed peace negotiations with Sandino:
- On the night of February 21, Sandino dined with President Sacasa at the Presidential Palace
- Upon leaving, Sandino and companions were arrested by National Guard officers
- Without consulting President Sacasa, Somoza ordered Sandino's execution
- Sandino, his brother Socrates, and generals Estrada and Umanzor were taken to El Hormiguero camp and killed
- Sandino's assassination was followed by the murder of former Sandino supporters by the National Guard
- This established Somoza's willingness to use violence against opponents

### The 1936 Coup
Under Somoza's command, the Guard became increasingly powerful:
- Somoza used the Guard to exert control over Nicaragua beyond even the president's authority
- He became embroiled in a power struggle with President Sacasa, his uncle-in-law
- In 1936, Anastasio Somoza Garcia executed a military coup
- Leveraging the National Guard, he overthrew President Sacasa
- Installed Carlos Brenes Jarquin as Acting President
- Somoza was nominated for presidency at a Liberal Party convention on June 16, 1936
- Inaugurated into office on January 1, 1937

### Sources of Power
Somoza Garcia derived power from three main sources:
1. **Economic Control**: Ownership or control of large portions of the Nicaraguan economy
2. **Military Force**: The National Guard answered to him personally
3. **U.S. Support**: Acceptance and backing from the United States government

---

## Methods of Control

### The National Guard (Guardia Nacional)

**Origins and U.S. Training**:
The National Guard was created in 1925 during U.S. occupation as a combined military and police force:
- Trained by U.S. Marine Corps
- Between 1959 and 1976, 4,897 members were trained directly by the U.S.
- From 1949 to 1973, 4,119 guardsmen attended Fort Gulick, Panama, for counterinsurgency training
- The U.S. formed, supported and trained this army, unique in Central America

**Structure and Loyalty**:
- Served as both army and national police
- Answered directly to Somoza, not to constitutional government
- What united the National Guard was neither professionalism nor party ideology but rather loyalty to Somoza and his personal and family interests
- Guard received paternalistic privileges from the dictator in exchange for unconditional protection
- Somoza promoted allies and purged enemies within the Guard
- Guard controlled not just military functions but telecommunications, railroads, customs, hospitals, and tax collection

**Repressive Methods**:
- Habitual practice of torture during interrogations
- Arbitrary detentions and imprisonment
- Summary executions of opponents
- Widespread torture, rape, and extrajudicial killings
- Used tear gas to break up demonstrations
- Arrested hundreds of citizens during protests
- Increased violence against people and communities suspected of collaborating with Sandinistas
- Displayed corpses as warnings

### Political Repression

**Censorship and Press Control**:
- In 1975, Somoza Debayle imposed a state of siege, censoring the press
- Independent newspapers harassed and threatened
- La Prensa, edited by Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, remained the only significant opposition newspaper
- Threatening all opponents with internment and torture
- Radio stations controlled or closed

**Political Prisoners**:
- Politicization of the justice system
- Arbitrary detentions and failure to comply with existing legislation
- Political prisoners smuggled letters out of jail to inform the public of conditions
- Thousands imprisoned over the regime's duration
- 1974: FSLN guerrillas took numerous prominent Nicaraguans hostage, forcing regime to release political prisoners

**Assassination and Disappearances**:
- Political opponents simply disappeared, never to be heard from again
- Systematic elimination of opposition leaders
- The murder of Sandino in 1934 set the pattern for dealing with threats

### Constitutional Manipulation
The Somozas maintained a facade of legality:
- Fraudulent elections held periodically
- Constitutional bans on re-election circumvented
- Luis Somoza technically restored the constitutional ban on immediate re-election in 1959
- Puppet presidents installed when needed (Rene Schick Gutierrez, Lorenzo Guerrero)
- Family maintained control regardless of who held formal office

### Economic Control and Kleptocracy

**Wealth Accumulation**:
- The family accumulated wealth through corporate bribes, industrial monopolies, land grabbing, and foreign aid siphoning
- By the 1970s, the family owned around 23% of the land in Nicaragua
- Somoza wealth speculated to have reached approximately $533 million
- This amounted to half of Nicaragua's debt and 33% of the country's 1979 GDP
- In 1979, Somoza family and closest friends controlled roughly 25% of the Nicaraguan economy

**Monopolization**:
- Control of key industries and businesses
- State contracts awarded to Somoza-linked companies
- Foreign aid routinely diverted to personal accounts
- National resources treated as family property

---

## Key Events & Atrocities

### Assassination of Augusto Cesar Sandino (February 21, 1934)
The foundational act of Somoza rule:
- Sandino assassinated in violation of safe-conduct agreement
- Established pattern of extralegal violence
- Subsequent murder of former Sandino supporters
- Consolidated Somoza's power within National Guard

### The 1972 Managua Earthquake
On December 23, 1972, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake devastated Managua:

**Immediate Impact**:
- 4,000-11,000 people killed (estimates vary)
- 20,000 injured
- Over 300,000 left homeless
- Widespread infrastructural damage to capital city

**Corruption of Relief Funds**:
- International aid poured in from 25+ countries worth millions of dollars
- Anastasio Somoza Debayle allocated relief funds in corrupt and self-serving manner
- International aid enriched the Somoza family instead of reaching victims
- Guard took control over distribution of relief aid
- Rumors of misappropriation began immediately
- Later revealed that Somoza and cronies had plundered much of the foreign aid
- Opposition increased rapidly among lower, middle, and upper classes

**Roberto Clemente Connection**:
Baseball star Roberto Clemente organized relief flights after reports of aid not reaching victims. His fourth relief flight crashed on December 31, 1972, killing him.

**Political Consequences**:
- Earthquake served as catalyst transforming fragmented society into multiclass coalition
- Consolidated efforts to challenge Somoza dictatorship
- Relationship between Somoza and elite class ruined

### Assassination of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro (January 10, 1978)
The murder that sparked revolution:

**The Victim**:

- Most prominent opposition voice in Nicaragua
- Fierce critic of Somoza family

**The Assassination**:
- Shot to death by hired assassins while driving his car in Managua
- Gunmen pulled up beside him and opened fire with shotguns

**Responsibility**:
- Somoza claimed Pedro Ramos, a Cuban-American businessman attacked by La Prensa, was responsible
- Chamorro family and opposition held that Somoza ordered the killing
- Ramos fled to Miami, tried in absentia after revolution, found guilty

**Impact**:
- Sparked general strikes and mass insurrection
- Closed off option of negotiated end to dictatorship
- U.S. cut off all aid to Somoza regime
- His death marked the beginning of the end for Somoza
- Date (January 10) later memorialized in 1987 Constitution as inauguration date for new governments

### The September 1978 Insurrection
Major uprising subdued by regime:
- Several thousand casualties, mostly civilian
- National Guard crackdown intensified
- Red Cross estimated 500+ dead and 1,000+ injured in one period of crackdown

### National Palace Raid (August 22, 1978)
FSLN's dramatic operation:
- Led by Eden Pastora ("Comandante Cero")
- Captured the National Palace while legislature was in session
- Took 2,000 hostages
- After two days, government agreed to pay $500,000 ransom
- Regime released political prisoners
- Major propaganda victory for FSLN

### Human Rights Violations Under Somoza Debayle

**1978 OAS Report**:
The Organization of American States issued a "blistering indictment" condemning the government for:
- "Serious, persistent and generalized violations"
- Indiscriminate bombing of civilian populations
- National Guard "mop-up" operations (execution of innocent citizens, including children)

## U.S. Relations

### The "Son of a Bitch" Quote
The phrase "He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch" is popularly attributed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt regarding Somoza:

**Historical Reality**:
- No archival evidence that FDR ever said this
- First appeared in Time magazine (November 15, 1948), three years after Roosevelt's death
- Some attribute it to Secretary of State Cordell Hull
- Andrew Crawley claims the statement is a myth created by Somoza himself
- The phrase has been applied to numerous U.S.-backed dictators (Trujillo, Batista, Marcos, Mobutu, Pinochet)

**What It Represents**:
Regardless of origin, the quote encapsulates U.S. Cold War policy of supporting anti-communist dictators despite their abuses.

### Early U.S. Support (1930s-1950s)
- U.S. Marines trained National Guard that brought Somoza to power
- Ambassador Matthew E. Hanna urged Somoza's appointment as Guard commander
- Somoza cultivated close ties with U.S. officials through his fluent English
- Haiti and Nicaragua viewed as strategically important for U.S. interests

### World War II and Post-War Era
- Nicaragua aligned with U.S. during WWII
- U.S. military mission arrived in 1950 to advise National Guard
- From 1946 to 1976, Somozas received more than $29 million in direct Military Assistance
- More than $300 million in "economic" aid, much used for military equipment

### Cold War Anti-Communism
The Somozas positioned themselves as essential anti-communist allies:
- After Cuban Revolution (1959), Somozas developed tighter relations with Cuban exiles
- 1961: Somoza lands used to train exiles for Bay of Pigs invasion
- Planes participating in Bay of Pigs took off from Nicaraguan territory
- Luis Somoza allowed CIA-trained Cuban rebels to embark from Puerto Cabezas
- Mann Doctrine (1966): U.S. would support dictatorships as long as they were not communist

### U.S. Military Training
- Between 1959-1976: 4,897 National Guard members trained directly by U.S.
- 1949-1973: 4,119 guardsmen attended Fort Gulick, Panama for counterinsurgency training
- The U.S. formed, supported and trained the National Guard

### Carter Administration and Human Rights (1977-1979)
The Carter administration changed U.S. policy:
- Made military assistance conditional on improvements to human rights
- 1977: U.S. began pressuring Somoza on abuses
- 1978: U.S. cut off aid over human rights violations
- Carter withdrew American support for the regime
- Televised murder of American journalist Bill Stewart by government soldiers galvanized U.S. opinion
- Left Somoza increasingly on his own to face the Sandinistas

## Scholarly Debate

### Revisionist Historiography
Recent scholarship has challenged one-dimensional portrayals of the Somoza regime:

**Knut Walter's Analysis** (*The Regime of Anastasio Somoza, 1936-1956*):
- "Outstanding contribution to Central American historiography"
- Challenges official view of Somocista ideology and practice
- Argues Somoza Garcia built a modern state that "in many ways resembled others throughout the continent"
- Shows the Nicaraguan state had "a life and a rationale of its own" beyond family enrichment
- Demonstrates Somoza's rise based on significant political support and alliance bridging Liberal-Conservative divide
- Makes compelling argument linking expansion of state/economy to Somoza's ability to neutralize opposition
- Scholars note work's relevance to understanding "political crisis of Sandinismo, whose failure in part was rooted in its one-dimensional understanding of Somocismo"

**Andrew Crawley's Work** (*Somoza and Roosevelt*):
- Analyzes "political, diplomatic, military, commercial, financial, and intelligence components of U.S. policy"
- Examines background to U.S. military withdrawal in early 1930s
- Argues FDR "son of a bitch" quote is myth created by Somoza himself

### Structural vs. Transnational Approaches
Scholars debate why the regime fell:

**Structuralist View**:
- Regime met conditions for vulnerability: sultanistic ruling style, unsustainable economic model, highly personalized National Guard

**Transnational View**:
- Internal conditions less important than external diplomatic changes
- Changing political environment outside Nicaragua was decisive
- Sandinistas' shrewd coalition-building crucial

### Labor and Political Alliance Studies
Walter demonstrates:
- Somoza's rise based on political alliance bridging Liberal-Conservative elite divide
- Close link between state/economic expansion and ability to neutralize opposition
- Somoza's expansion of state's repressive and service delivery capacity "helped to create legitimacy for the Nicaraguan state"

### U.S. Responsibility
Scholars debate extent of U.S. culpability:
- U.S. created and trained the National Guard that enabled Somoza rule
- Cold War imperatives shaped policy despite known abuses
- Some argue U.S. bears significant moral responsibility
- Others emphasize limits of U.S. influence over sovereign allies

### Gaps in Scholarship
- Few studies of Nicaragua's twentieth-century history prior to Sandinista revolution
- Notable exceptions: Richard Millett's *Guardians of the Dynasty* and Knut Walter's work
- Some works (e.g., Gambone's Eisenhower study) criticized for "confused understanding of basic Nicaraguan history"

## Confidence Assessment
**Overall**: Medium-High

**Notes**:
- Death toll estimates for 1978-1979 revolution range from 30,000-50,000; genuine uncertainty in historical record
- Exact number killed during 43 years of repression difficult to determine
- FDR "son of a bitch" quote almost certainly apocryphal despite widespread attribution
- U.S. involvement well-documented through declassified records and official histories
- Key events (Sandino assassination, 1972 earthquake, Chamorro murder) well-documented
- Scholarly consensus exists on general characterization of regime
- Revisionist scholarship (Walter, Crawley) provides more nuanced picture than revolutionary-era accounts

**Areas of Higher Confidence**:
- Timeline and succession of three Somozas
- U.S. role in creating and supporting National Guard
- 1972 earthquake corruption
- Sandinista Revolution events
- Methods of control and repression

**Areas of Lower Confidence**:
- Precise death tolls during 43 years of rule
- Full extent of stolen wealth (estimates vary from $500 million to higher)
- Degree of popular support/acquiescence to regime
- Exact responsibility for Chamorro assassination

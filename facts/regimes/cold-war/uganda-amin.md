# Uganda Under Idi Amin

## Overview
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Country/Region** | Uganda |
| **Dates** | January 25, 1971 - April 11, 1979 |
| **Leader(s)** | Idi Amin Dada (c. 1925-2003) |
| **Type** | Personalist military dictatorship |
| **Duration** | 8 years, 2.5 months |
| **Estimated Death Toll** | 100,000 - 500,000 (most commonly cited: 300,000) |

## Key Figures
- **Idi Amin Dada** - President of Uganda (1971-1979); Commander-in-Chief; self-proclaimed "His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, CBE, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular"
- **Mustafa Adrisi** - Vice President and Defence Minister; member of Amin's Kakwa tribe; allegedly involved in Archbishop Luwum's murder
- **Isaac Maliyamungu** - One of Amin's most feared officers; alleged perpetrator of Archbishop Luwum's murder; killed suspected collaborators after Entebbe raid
- **Moses Ali** - Brigadier and Minister of Finance; close to Amin until falling out in 1978; later led rebel group in exile
- **Bob Astles** - British advisor known as "the White Rat"; head of anti-corruption squad; controversial figure who claimed to be a moderating influence
- **Juma Oris** - Minister of Foreign Affairs; Kakwa tribe member; loyal to Amin
- **Farouk Minawa** - Head of the State Research Bureau (secret police)

## Classification
Personalist military dictatorship characterized by:
- Military coup origins with consolidation into personal rule
- President declared "President for Life" in 1976
- Rule by decree rather than through institutions
- Secret police apparatus (State Research Bureau) answering directly to Amin
- Ethnic persecution and extrajudicial killings as state policy
- No other officer had substantial influence on basic policy decisions
- Military did not rule as an institution despite military origins

Political scientists distinguish Amin's regime from pure military regimes because power was concentrated in Amin personally rather than in the military as an institution. Scholars like Barbara Geddes classify it as personalist rather than military for this reason.

## Pre-Conditions

### Milton Obote's First Regime (1962-1971)
Uganda achieved independence from Great Britain in October 1962, with Milton Obote becoming the first prime minister. Obote faced significant challenges:
- Arbitrarily drawn colonial boundaries
- Tribal loyalties conflicting with national interests
- Regional separatist movements (particularly Buganda)
- Governmental corruption

### The Buganda Crisis (1966)
The relationship between the central government and the Kingdom of Buganda deteriorated:
- **1966 Constitutional Crisis**: Obote suspended the constitution and dismissed the Kabaka (king) of Buganda, Edward Mutesa II, who also served as Uganda's ceremonial president
- **Attack on the Palace**: Amin led troops in a brutal assault on the Kabaka's palace, forcing Mutesa to flee to Britain where he died in exile in 1969
- **Consequences**: First use of military in Ugandan politics; civilians killed in indiscriminate attacks; precedent set for military intervention

### Economic and Political Grievances
- Obote's socialist-oriented policies ("Move to the Left") were widely discredited
- Rising taxes including graduated tax, sales taxes, and social security contributions
- Increasing prices of education and healthcare
- Falling agricultural prices
- Ethnic favoritism with Obote accused of favoring his Langi ethnic group

### External Opposition
Foreign powers were hostile to Obote's socialist policies:
- **Britain**: Opposed "Move to the Left" policies that threatened international corporations
- **United States**: Cold War concerns about socialist orientation
- **Israel**: Had established military relationship with Uganda; allegedly supported coup plotters

### Amin-Obote Tensions
Relations between Amin and Obote deteriorated severely:
- October 1970: Obote reduced Amin from overall military commander to army commander only
- Amin learned of impending arrest for misappropriating army funds
- Personal survival became Amin's primary motivation for the coup

---

## Rise to Power

### The January 25, 1971 Coup

**Timing**: The coup was launched while Obote was attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Singapore.

**Timeline**:
- Troops loyal to Amin sealed off Entebbe International Airport
- Military forces took Kampala and surrounded Obote's residence
- Major roads were blocked
- Obote loyalists were too disorganized to offer effective resistance
- 4:30 PM: Amin announced army and police control of the entire country

**Israeli Involvement**: Amin seized power with assistance of Israeli government agents who had been training the Ugandan military. Israel initially supported Amin but relations would later deteriorate dramatically.

### Initial Reception
The coup was initially welcomed both domestically and internationally:
- **Domestic**: Obote was unpopular, especially in Buganda; Amin freed political prisoners and allowed the Kabaka's body to return for burial
- **British**: Relief at end of socialist policies
- **American**: Satisfaction at removing perceived socialist threat
- **Israeli**: Happy to see end of Obote whom they distrusted

Amin was initially seen as a liberator rather than the tyrant he would become.

### Consolidation of Power
Amin quickly moved to eliminate potential opposition:
- By early 1972: ~5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers "disappeared" (Obote's ethnic groups)
- At least twice as many civilians from these groups killed
- Installed himself as President, ruling by decree
- Became President for Life in 1976
- Accumulated grandiose titles

## Methods of Control

### State Research Bureau (SRB) - Secret Police

**Establishment**:
- Created in February 1971 by decree as military intelligence agency
- Replaced the General Service Unit (GSU) which Amin had accused of terrorizing Ugandans
- Initially named State Research Centre; renamed SRB in early 1972 after Israeli technicians were expelled
- Headed by Farouk Minawa

**Training**:
- Initially trained by Israeli agents
- After 1972: Soviet agents instructed SRB personnel in KGB methods
- Many agents sent to USSR for specialized training
- Others received military and police training in US and UK

**Operations**:
- Headquarters described as "a gross abuse of reality. There was neither research, nor were state matters dealt with"
- Maintained wide network of informants throughout society
- Conducted surveillance, arbitrary detentions, and extrajudicial killings
- Operated with complete impunity outside legal oversight
- Thousands of Ugandans met their end in subterranean cells at SRB headquarters

**Torture Methods**:
- Sledgehammers used to kill prisoners
- Victims bound, thrown to ground, and shot
- Some doused with gasoline and burned alive
- Some fed to crocodiles
- "Gestapo-like interrogation techniques"
- Survivors reported: "They rarely wasted any bullets on us"

**End of SRB**:
- When Kampala fell in 1979, agents threw grenades into holding cells, killing approximately 100 detainees
- 13 survivors freed by Tanzanian forces
- Journalists discovered extensive undestroyed documents proving torture and murder
- New government disbanded SRB

### Public Safety Unit (PSU) and Military Police (MP)
In addition to the SRB, two other organizations were responsible for most deaths:
- Public Safety Unit (PSU)
- Military Police (MP)
- All three either operated as death squads or harbored death squad units within their ranks

### Media Control and Propaganda

**Radio Uganda**:
- November 1971: Four 100-kilowatt radio transmitting towers completed, giving Uganda one of Africa's most powerful broadcasting stations
- Private radio stations banned; Radio Uganda became sole broadcaster
- Survey showed 8 out of 10 adult Ugandans received news from Radio Uganda
- Amin regularly spoke on radio about whatever interested him; almost all Ugandans knew his voice
- In an ominous twist, people sometimes learned by radio that they were "about to disappear"

**The Voice of Uganda**:
- State newspaper used for propaganda purposes
- Editorials supported regime policies

**Media Philosophy**:
Amin called local press, radio, and television his "ears, eyes and voices" and used them alongside mercenaries to distort reality.
- No press freedom existed
- Most local media obtained information from state-run Uganda News Agency
- Propaganda often fantastical (e.g., claims that Tanzanian units were wiped out by crocodiles; that Amin could defeat 20,000 Tanzanians with 20 soldiers)
- Amin's wife Sarah Kyolaba allegedly led battalion of armed women (no proof ever surfaced)

**Media Manipulation**:
Anthropologist Mark Leopold notes that Amin "might have been the earliest politician to realise the importance of mass media. He saw the need to dominate news by all means necessary even if it meant saying or doing ridiculous things."

Amin famously stated: "There is freedom of speech, but I cannot guarantee freedom after speech."

### Ethnic and Religious Targeting
Victims included:
- Acholi and Lango soldiers and civilians (Obote's ethnic groups)
- Members of other ethnic groups deemed threatening
- Religious leaders
- Journalists
- Artists
- Senior bureaucrats
- Judges
- Lawyers
- Students and intellectuals
- Criminal suspects
- Foreign nationals

Killings were motivated by ethnic, political, and financial factors.

| Source | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| Amnesty International (1979) | 100,000 - 500,000 |

---

## Opposition & Resistance

### 1972 Obote Invasion Attempt
- Exiled President Obote organized invasion from Tanzania with President Nyerere's support
- Attempt failed
- Obote remained in Tanzania; joined by 20,000 Ugandan refugees

### Internal Dissent
- Limited organized resistance possible given surveillance state
- Some fled into exile
- Those who voiced opposition typically disappeared

### International Criticism
- Human rights organizations documented abuses
- Amnesty International issued 1979 report
- International condemnation grew throughout 1970s
- Some foreign journalists and diplomats advocated for action
- British Foreign Secretary David Owen later revealed he had proposed assassinating Amin

---

## Fall / End

### The Uganda-Tanzania War (October 1978 - April 1979)

**Origins**:
- Relations between Tanzania and Uganda tense since 1971 coup
- Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere supported Obote and backed 1972 invasion attempt
- October 1978: Ugandan forces invaded Kagera Salient in northern Tanzania
- November 1978: Amin announced annexation of all Tanzanian territory north of Kagera River

**Tanzanian Response**:
- President Nyerere decided Amin must be removed
- Tanzanian People's Defence Force (TPDF) launched counter-offensive
- December 25: Large-scale artillery bombardment along border using BM-21 Grad rocket launchers
- Ugandans nicknamed rockets "Saba-Saba"; terrified by their destructive power
- Ugandan forces lacked capability to counter Tanzanian artillery

**Libyan Intervention**:
- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi considered Uganda a Muslim state threatened by "Christian army"
- Viewed Uganda as counterbalance to Sudan and Egypt in northeast Africa
- Mid-February 1979: Libyan troops flown to Entebbe
- Early March: Libyan government denied sending forces (false)
- Libyan forces proved ineffective; some refused to fight

**Fall of Kampala (April 11, 1979)**:
- Tanzanian forces and Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) captured the capital
- Combined force of approximately 45,000 Tanzanian troops and Ugandan exiles
- Amin's forces collapsed

**Amin's Flight**:
- Fled Uganda by air with four wives, twenty children, and several mistresses
- First stop: Libya
- Second stop: Iraq
- Final destination: Jeddah, Saudi Arabia

**Significance**:
- First overthrow of sovereign head of state by foreign military in post-colonial Africa
- Contravened Charter of Organisation of African Unity (OAU)
- OAU failed to resolve conflict, demonstrating its limitations
- Scholar Benoni Turyahikayo-Rugyema: "Had Amin not invaded the Kagera Salient in Tanzania he probably would still be ruling Uganda"

---

## Aftermath

### Transitional Governments (1979-1980)
- **April 1979**: Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF) coalition government formed
- **Yusufu Lule**: First post-Amin president; removed after only 68 days for allegedly promoting Ganda interests
- **Godfrey Binaisa**: Replaced Lule; tenure lasted only 11 months
- **Military Commission**: Briefly ruled; included future president Yoweri Museveni
- **Presidential Commission of Uganda**: Transitional body

### "Obote II" Regime (1980-1985)
- December 1980: Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress (UPC) won controversial elections
- Elections reported as neither free nor fair
- Civil war erupted in early 1980s
- Obote II regime involved more death and destruction than Amin's entire tenure according to some scholars
- Army (largely Acholi and Lango) ravaged countryside; took vengeance on Ganda population
- Extraordinary inflation; urban wage earners could not keep pace with prices
- 1985: Internal army split between Acholi and Lango factions led to Obote's second overthrow

### Tito Okello and Museveni (1985-1986)
- July 1985: Acholi General Tito Okello seized power
- January 1986: Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Movement (NRM) seized power
- Museveni has remained president since 1986

### Amin's Exile and Death

**Saudi Arabia**:
- Saudi royal family granted sanctuary in exchange for staying out of politics
- Received monthly pension, home, and servants
- Lived in spacious villa with approximately half-dozen of his 30+ children
- Seen pushing cart in supermarket, getting massaged at health club, praying at mosque
- 1989: Attempted return to Uganda; stopped in Zaire (now DRC) and forced back to Saudi Arabia

**Death**:
- July 19, 2003: Amin entered coma from kidney failure at King Faisal Specialist Hospital, Jeddah
- Fourth wife Nalongo Madina pleaded for permission to return him to Uganda
- President Museveni: Amin would have to "answer for his sins the moment he was brought back"
- August 16, 2003: Family disconnected life support; Amin died
- Buried in Ruwais Cemetery, Jeddah in simple grave without fanfare

**No Justice**:
- No nation attempted to bring Amin to trial during nearly quarter-century of exile
- Amnesty International noted his comfortable exile underlined need for international justice system
- Human Rights Watch raised his case with UN Commission on Human Rights without success
- Died "unrepentant and unpunished"

### Amin's Family
- **Taban Amin** (eldest son): Led West Nile Bank Front rebel group until 2003; offered amnesty by Museveni in 2005; appointed Deputy Director General of Internal Security Organisation in 2006

### Uganda's Recovery
- Amin's era was traumatizing for millions of Ugandans
- Uganda has lived under shadow of Amin ever since
- Majority of current Ugandans have no direct memory of his regime
- Economy slowly rebuilt under subsequent governments

### Revelation About British Plans
- After Amin's death, former British Foreign Secretary David Owen (1977-1979) revealed he had proposed assassinating Amin
- Owen defended this: "I'm not ashamed of considering it, because his regime goes down in the scale of Pol Pot as one of the worst of all African regimes"

---

## Scholarly Debate

### Death Toll Controversy
**Higher Estimates (100,000 - 500,000)**:
- Amnesty International's 1979 report concluded 100,000 - 500,000 killed since 1971
- Most commonly cited figure is approximately 300,000
- Supported by documented mass killings and systematic disappearances

**Lower Estimates (12,000 - 30,000)**:
- Scholar Jan J. Jorgenson has questioned higher estimates
- Argues for range of 12,000 - 30,000

**A.B.K. Kasozi's Research**:
- "The Social Origins of Violence in Uganda 1964-1985" (1994)
- Deeply researched account suggesting up to 300,000 deaths for political motives
- Notable finding: Obote II regime (1980-1985) may have caused more deaths than Amin's

### Personal Tyranny vs. Structural Analysis
**Personal Tyranny View**:
- Amin as uniquely brutal individual responsible for violence
- Focus on his psychology and apparent cruelty

**Structural Analysis**:
- Journalists Avirgan and Honey: "Facile explanations of Amin's regime, as either a one-man show or a lawless and ruthless band of killers, do not get at the heart of the power structure"
- Mahmood Mamdani sought to "dissect every nerve and muscle of fascism" to identify conditions enabling the regime
- Focus on colonial inheritance, ethnic divisions, institutional weaknesses

### The "Buffoon" Question
**Media Portrayal**:
- Western media framed Amin as "bloodthirsty clown and unstable despot"
- Racialized in bluntest terms, drawing on European stereotypes about African leaders

**Strategic Self-Presentation**:
- Some commentators suggest Amin deliberately cultivated eccentric reputation
- Used to defuse international concern over his administration
- Ugandan soldier Patrick Kimumwe: Amin's "clowning conceal[ed] a ruthless extinction of human rights"

### Recent Revisionist Scholarship
**Derek Peterson's Research**:
- "A Popular History of Idi Amin's Uganda" (Yale University Press)
- Uses recently uncovered archival material
- Asks how regime survived for eight years
- Examines ordinary people (civil servants, curators, artists, businesspeople) who invested energy in making government work
- Reveals how Amin led people to see themselves as soldiers in war against imperialism

**Other Recent Scholars**:
- Doreen Kembabazi, Kate Bruce-Lockhart, Marissa Mika
- Examine how institutions continued functioning during regime
- Challenge simple narrative of total state collapse

### Understanding Media and Power
Anthropologist Mark Leopold argues Amin "might have been the earliest politician to realise the importance of mass media" - willing to say or do ridiculous but dramatic things to dominate news coverage.

### Comparative Brutality
Scholars debate whether Amin was Uganda's worst leader:
- Some evidence suggests Obote II regime (1980-1985) caused more deaths
- Amin's notoriety may stem partly from media coverage rather than absolute numbers
- Both periods involved massive state violence

## Comparisons
- [[chile-pinochet]] - relationship: temporal (Cold War dictator; U.S. initially positive about both coups)
- [[argentina-junta]] - relationship: temporal (Cold War military regime; death squads; disappearances)
- [[cambodia-khmer-rouge]] - relationship: thematic (mass killings; international isolation; overthrown by foreign invasion)
- [[zimbabwe-mugabe]] - relationship: thematic (post-colonial African dictatorship; economic collapse; expulsion of minority population)
- [[libya-gaddafi]] - relationship: direct (Gaddafi allied with Amin; sent troops to Uganda 1979; gave Amin first refuge)

## Confidence Assessment
**Overall**: Medium-High

**Notes**:
- **Well-documented**: Coup events, Asian expulsion, key atrocities (Luwum, Bloch), fall of regime, exile and death
- **Multiple sources corroborate**: State Research Bureau operations, torture methods, media control tactics
- **Death toll uncertainty**: Range of 100,000 - 500,000 reflects genuine scholarly disagreement; 300,000 most commonly cited but not definitively established
- **Lower estimate exists**: Jorgenson's 12,000-30,000 estimate is minority view but represents legitimate scholarly skepticism
- **Documentation gaps**: Many SRB documents were preserved but systematic academic analysis remains incomplete
- **Survivor testimony**: Limited compared to regimes with formal truth commissions
- **Areas of debate**: Amin's motivations, extent of foreign involvement in 1971 coup, comparative death toll vs. Obote II
- **Recent scholarship**: Derek Peterson and others are revising understanding of how regime functioned day-to-day

## Pre-Conditions

### French Colonial Rule
Guinea was part of French West Africa from 1891 until independence in 1958:
- Colonial extraction economy focused on bauxite, iron ore, and agricultural products
- Limited development of infrastructure and education
- Indigenous political expression suppressed
- Chiefs co-opted into colonial administration
- Growing nationalist sentiment after World War II

### Rise of the Independence Movement
Post-war Africa saw rising nationalist movements:
- **1946**: African Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Democratique Africain - RDA) founded as pan-African alliance of political parties
- **1947**: Democratic Party of Guinea (PDG) formed as the Guinean branch of the RDA
- Sekou Toure emerged as a labor organizer and union leader
- PDG mobilized workers, farmers, and market women against colonial chiefs who supported French rule
- **1956**: Toure elected to French National Assembly as Guinea's deputy
- **1957**: PDG won 56 of 60 seats in territorial elections; Toure became mayor of Conakry

### The de Gaulle Referendum
The collapse of the French Fourth Republic in 1958 led to a constitutional crisis:
- General Charles de Gaulle offered French colonies a choice: autonomy within the French Community or immediate independence
- Referendum scheduled for September 28, 1958
- De Gaulle visited Conakry on August 25, 1958, where Toure delivered his famous defiant speech
- All other French African territories voted for the French Community; Guinea alone voted "No" (95% against)

---

## Rise to Power

### Independence: October 2, 1958
Guinea became the first French-speaking African nation to achieve full independence:
- Following the referendum, France withdrew immediately and vindictively
- French personnel destroyed equipment, files, and infrastructure as they departed
- France suspended all aid, technical assistance, and investment
- Even telephone lines connecting government offices were severed
- Medical supplies and educational materials removed
- This "scorched earth" withdrawal created lasting bitterness

### Toure as First President
Sekou Toure was named president of the new republic on October 2, 1958:
- Immediately established PDG as the sole legal political party
- Guinea emerged as a one-party state from the moment of independence
- Famous declaration: "We prefer freedom in poverty to riches in slavery" (*Nous preferons la liberte dans la pauvrete a la richesse dans l'esclavage*)

### International Support
Isolated by France and the West, Guinea turned to alternative allies:
- **Ghana**: President Kwame Nkrumah immediately extended a loan of 10 million pounds; announced Ghana-Guinea Union
- **Soviet Union**: Became primary sponsor, providing economic and military aid
- **Eastern Bloc**: Extensive ties with communist states
- **China**: Provided aid and ideological support
- Guinea became a symbol of radical anti-colonialism in Africa

### Consolidation of Power
Toure rapidly concentrated authority:
- **1960**: Declared PDG the only legal political party
- All citizens automatically members of PDG from birth
- Local PDG committees established surveillance networks throughout society
- Security apparatus built with Soviet assistance
- Nationalization of foreign-owned enterprises
- Opposition figures arrested, exiled, or executed

---

## Methods of Control

### The PDG Single-Party System
The Democratic Party of Guinea permeated all aspects of Guinean life:
- Every citizen was automatically a party member from birth
- Local Revolutionary Committees (Pouvoir Revolutionnaire Local - PRL) monitored neighborhoods
- Party cells existed in every workplace, school, and village
- Mandatory attendance at political education sessions
- Denunciations encouraged; informants rewarded
- No independent civil society organizations permitted

### Camp Boiro: The Political Prison
Camp Boiro (also known as Camp Mamadou Boiro) became the symbol of Toure's repression:

**Overview**:
- Former Republican Guard barracks in Donka suburb of Conakry
- Converted to political prison and torture center from 1960 to 1984
- Under command of Siaka Toure for most of its operation
- Siaka Toure was "sole master of the camp," controlling all entries and exits

**Death Toll Estimates**:
- Conservative estimate: 5,000 executed or died from torture/starvation
- Higher estimates: Up to 50,000 victims
- Amnesty International and other human rights organizations cite the higher figure
- Mass graves continue to be discovered throughout Guinea

**Torture Methods**:
- **"Diete noire" (Black Diet)**: Complete deprivation of food and water until death
- Electroshocks
- Sexual violence
- Physical beatings
- Psychological torture and mock executions
- Prisoners held in cramped, dark cells

**Conditions**:
- Prisoners received minimal food: "a scrap of bread the size of a box of matches in the morning, and a ladle of plain rice cooked in dirty water in the evening"
- No meat except on days Toure performed religious sacrifices
- Many died from starvation, disease, or torture before formal execution
- Prisoners showed courage by "refusing to confess during torture sessions and refusing to beg for food when placed on the black diet"

### Revolutionary Committees and Show Trials
The regime institutionalized political terror through committees:
- **1969**: After the "Labe Plot," a three-person Revolutionary Committee was established consisting of President Toure, General Lansana Diane, and Captain Siaka Toure
- **1971**: Ismael Toure headed interrogation committees at Camp Boiro
- Forced confessions extracted through torture
- Public broadcasts of confessions
- Mass trials and public executions

### Purges and the "Permanent Plot"
Toure's regime was characterized by constant discovery of alleged conspiracies:
- "Plots" announced regularly to justify purges
- Used to eliminate potential rivals, critics, and ethnic groups
- Each plot followed by waves of arrests and executions
- Created atmosphere of permanent fear and surveillance
- Notable alleged plots:
  - **1960**: Early plot allegations (anti-Fulani overtones)
  - **1969**: "Labe Plot" targeting military officers
  - **1970**: Post-Portuguese invasion purges
  - **1971**: "Fifth Column" accusations after November 1970 invasion
  - **1976**: "Fulani Conspiracy" - first explicit ethnic targeting

### Ethnic Persecution: The Fulani (Peul)
The Fulani (Peul, Fulbe) ethnic group faced systematic persecution:

**Background**:
- Fulani are the largest ethnic group in Guinea's Fouta Djallon highlands
- Historically associated with trade, education, and Islamic scholarship
- Perceived by Toure as potential rivals to Malinke dominance

**The 1976 "Fulani Conspiracy"**:
- Government denounced a "conspiracy of the Peuls" - first explicit ethnic targeting
- Toure delivered three virulent speeches calling Fulani "traitors" who "think only of money"
- Used as scapegoat for national problems: medicine shortages, cholera epidemic, even soccer team defeats
- Toure declared: "We will annihilate them immediately, not by race war, but by radical revolutionary war"

**"Malinkaization"**:
- After 1965, Malinke (Toure's ethnic group) increasingly dominated government
- Fulani held only 11% of administrative positions
- Systematic exclusion from party, bureaucracy, and military leadership
- Prominent Fulani intellectuals targeted for elimination

**Exodus**:
- Up to 2 million Guineans (one-third of population) fled into exile
- Majority were Fulani
- Fled to Senegal, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, and beyond
- Weakened civil society and intellectual class

---

## Key Events & Atrocities

### The "Permanent Plots" (1960-1984)
Throughout his rule, Toure announced numerous alleged conspiracies:
- Each "plot" provided justification for mass arrests and executions
- Pattern: accusation, arrest, torture, forced confession, trial, execution
- Created climate of permanent terror where anyone could be accused

### Portuguese Invasion - Operation Green Sea (November 22, 1970)
One of the most significant events of Toure's rule:

**The Attack**:
- Portuguese military launched amphibious assault on Conakry (Operation Mar Verde)
- 350-420 Portuguese soldiers and Portuguese-led Guinean fighters
- Six warships surrounded the sleeping capital
- Commander Alpoim Calvao led the operation

**Objectives**:
- Overthrow Sekou Toure's government
- Capture PAIGC leader Amilcar Cabral (Guinea supported anti-Portuguese guerrillas)
- Destroy PAIGC naval assets and supply lines
- Free Portuguese prisoners of war held at Camp Boiro

**Results**:
- 26 Portuguese POWs freed (some held for seven years)
- PAIGC vessels destroyed
- Toure's summer residence burned
- Failed to capture Amilcar Cabral or overthrow regime

**International Response**:
- **UN Security Council Resolution 290** (December 8, 1970) condemned Portugal
- Organization of African Unity unanimously condemned the invasion
- Soviet Union sent warships to protect Guinea
- Nigeria and Algeria offered military support

**Aftermath for Guinea**:
- Toure used invasion to justify massive purges
- Announced existence of "fifth columnists" who aided invaders
- Thousands arrested and sent to Camp Boiro
- Wave of executions in January 1971

### The Hangings of January 25, 1971
Following the Portuguese invasion, mass executions took place:
- Prominent figures accused of collaboration with invaders
- Public hangings broadcast on radio
- Included military officers, civil servants, and alleged conspirators
- **Notable victim**: Achkar Marof, actor and former Guinean ambassador to the United Nations, shot on January 26, 1971

### Assassination of Amilcar Cabral (January 20, 1973)
The PAIGC leader was assassinated in Conakry:
- Cabral had been based in Guinea since 1960
- Killed by dissidents within PAIGC, allegedly with Toure's knowledge
- Timing suspicious given deteriorating relations between Toure and PAIGC
- Removed a potential rival for Pan-African leadership

### The 1976 "Fulani Conspiracy" and Death of Diallo Telli
The most notorious purge targeted Fulani elites:

**Diallo Telli** (1925-1977):
- First Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) 1964-1972
- One of Africa's most distinguished diplomats
- Later served as Guinea's Minister of Justice
- Arrested July 18, 1976, at his home
- Accused of leading "Fulani plot" against the state
- Subjected to torture and forced to sign incoherent "confession"
- Killed by "diete noire" (black diet) in February-March 1977
- Died March 1-2, 1977 in Cell 52 of Camp Boiro
- Body thrown into mass grave
- The OAU did not publicly react to the death of its former Secretary General

**Other February 1977 Victims** (killed by black diet):
- Barry Alpha Oumar (ex-minister)
- Drame Alioune (ex-minister)
- Fode Cisse (ex-minister)
- Diallo Alhassana (army officer)
- Kouyate Lamine (army officer)

### Market Women's Revolt (1977)
A rare moment of public resistance:
- Women traders demonstrated against regulations prohibiting private commerce
- Siaka Toure met demonstrators with troops
- When protesters refused to disperse, troops opened fire
- At least one woman killed; many arrested

### Economic Collapse
Toure's socialist policies led to economic devastation:
- Nationalization of all major enterprises
- State monopoly on trade
- Collectivization attempts
- Chronic shortages of basic goods
- Despite vast mineral wealth (bauxite, iron ore, diamonds), widespread poverty
- Black market economy flourished
- Inflation and currency devaluation

---

## Opposition & Resistance

### Internal Opposition
Organized internal resistance was virtually impossible:
- Surveillance network penetrated all levels of society
- Informants in every workplace, neighborhood, and family
- Speaking against the regime meant arrest and Camp Boiro
- Most dissent expressed only in private or through exile

### Exile Communities
Large diaspora communities formed:
- Estimated 1.5-2 million Guineans fled (up to one-third of population)
- Exile communities in Senegal, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, France
- Some organized political opposition from abroad
- Many were intellectuals, professionals, and ethnic Fulani

### The FNLG (National Liberation Front of Guinea)
Exile opposition attempted to organize:
- Various exile groups formed throughout Toure's rule
- Limited effectiveness due to regime's security apparatus
- Some collaborated with Portuguese during 1970 invasion
- Used by Toure to justify domestic repression

### International Criticism
Growing international awareness of abuses:
- **1977**: International League for Human Rights estimated over 3,000 political prisoners
- Amnesty International documented torture and executions
- Western media increasingly critical in later years
- However, Cold War dynamics protected Toure from serious consequences

---

## Fall / End

### Late Period Moderation (Late 1970s-1984)
In his final years, Toure moderated some policies:
- **1978**: Formally renounced Marxism
- Rapprochement with France and Western nations
- Eased some economic controls
- Released some political prisoners
- However, Camp Boiro continued to operate
- Security apparatus remained intact

### Death of Sekou Toure (March 26, 1984)
Toure died suddenly while seeking medical treatment abroad:
- March 1984: Traveling to Saudi Arabia to mediate Western Sahara dispute
- Suffered heart attack in Saudi Arabia on March 25
- Rushed to Cleveland Clinic in Ohio for emergency heart surgery
- Died on March 26, 1984, during surgery
- Had ruled Guinea for over 25 years
- Age 62 at death

---

## Aftermath

### The 1984 Military Coup (April 3, 1984)
The military seized power one week after Toure's death:

**Timing**:
- Prime Minister Louis Lansana Beavogui serving as interim president
- PDG Politburo scheduled to meet to select new leader
- Beavogui expected to win and serve seven-year term
- Military struck "just hours before" the Politburo meeting

**The Coup**:
- Bloodless military takeover led by Colonel Lansana Conte
- Military Committee of National Restoration (CMRN) took power
- Conte became president on April 5, 1984

**Immediate Actions**:
- Constitution suspended
- National Assembly dissolved
- PDG abolished (ending 26 years of single-party rule)
- Denounced Toure's rule as a "bloody and ruthless dictatorship"
- Released approximately 1,000 political prisoners
- Camp Boiro closed as political prison
- Named victims "martyrs" who "lost their lives simply because they wanted to express their opinions"

### Execution of Toure's Associates (1985)
Following a failed coup attempt in July 1985:
- Lieutenant Colonel Diarra Traore attempted to seize power
- Coup failed; Traore executed
- Conte used opportunity to eliminate remaining Toure loyalists
- **Executed**: Ismael Toure, Siaka Toure, Mamadi Keita, Moussa Diakite
- Marked definitive end of Toure era

### Conte's Rule (1984-2008)
Colonel (later General) Lansana Conte ruled until his death:
- Initially promised democracy; delayed elections repeatedly
- Became increasingly authoritarian over time
- Economic liberalization but continued political repression
- Died December 22, 2008, after 24 years in power
- Another military coup followed his death

### The Association of Victims of Camp Boiro (AVCB)
Survivors and victims' families organized:
- Created to locate mass graves
- Honor victims and preserve memory
- Seek recovery of confiscated property
- Advocate for accountability
- Mass graves continue to be discovered

### Long-Term Legacy
Toure's rule left lasting impacts on Guinea:
- **Political**: Pattern of authoritarianism continued; no democratic tradition established
- **Economic**: Decades of mismanagement; infrastructure collapsed; poverty endemic
- **Social**: Ethnic tensions between Malinke, Fulani, and Soussou persist
- **Institutional**: Weak civil society; limited independent judiciary or press
- **Human**: Generation of intellectuals killed or exiled; trauma unaddressed

### Memory Wars
Guinea remains divided over Toure's legacy:
- Some venerate him as father of independence, anti-colonial hero
- Others remember him as tyrant responsible for tens of thousands of deaths
- No comprehensive truth and reconciliation process
- Successive governments have not fully addressed the past
- Fulani community particularly affected by historical trauma

---

## Scholarly Debate

### Revolutionary Hero vs. Tyrant
Academic assessment of Toure remains contested:

**The "Hero" Narrative**:
- First leader of French-speaking Africa to achieve full independence
- Defied de Gaulle and rejected neocolonialism
- Promoted Pan-Africanism and African unity
- Supported liberation movements (PAIGC, ANC, others)
- Developed ideology combining African values with socialism
- "Outstanding revolutionary socialist thinker" according to some scholars
- Symbol of African dignity and resistance to imperialism

**The "Tyrant" Narrative**:
- Ruled as "virtual dictator" from 1960 onward
- Responsible for deaths of 50,000+ people
- Created "Tropical Gulag" prison system
- Ethnically persecuted Fulani population
- Destroyed Guinea's economy despite vast natural resources
- Drove 2 million Guineans (one-third of population) into exile
- Paranoid leadership that saw conspiracies everywhere

**The "Hero and Tyrant" Synthesis**:
- Ibrahima Baba Kake's biography *Le Heros et le Tyran* (1987) captures the duality
- "Between heroism and tyranny lies an intriguing personality with extraordinary capacity for both admirable and despicable deeds"
- Toure as brilliant but deeply flawed figure
- Independence achievement cannot be separated from subsequent repression

### Blame Distribution Debate
Scholars debate responsibility for atrocities:
- **Personal responsibility**: Toure personally directed repression; paranoid psychology drove purges
- **Inner circle blame**: Some sympathizers blame half-brothers Ismael and Siaka Toure for "worst excesses"
- **Structural factors**: Cold War dynamics, French hostility, and weak institutions contributed
- **Ideological critique**: Marxist-Leninist one-party model inherently repressive

### Ethnic Dimensions
The role of ethnicity remains debated:
- Did Toure cynically manipulate ethnic tensions or genuinely believe in Fulani conspiracies?
- Was "Malinkaization" deliberate policy or organic result of party dominance?
- How much did colonial ethnic divisions shape post-independence conflict?
- Legacy of ethnic persecution continues to affect Guinean politics

### Ideological Evolution
Toure's ideological shifts invite analysis:
- Early period: Revolutionary socialism aligned with Soviet Union
- Middle period: Intensified radicalism with Marxist-Leninist emphasis
- Late period: Rapprochement with France and West; renounced Marxism in 1978
- Question: Was Toure primarily ideologue or opportunist?

### Comparison to Other Regimes
Scholars compare Toure's Guinea to:
- **Stalin's USSR**: "Tropical Gulag" terminology; purges and show trials
- **Other African dictatorships**: Amin (Uganda), Macias (Equatorial Guinea), Mengistu (Ethiopia)
- **One-party socialist states**: Similar trajectory of revolutionary promise becoming repression
- Unique aspects: French colonial legacy, particular ethnic dynamics, international isolation

---

## Comparisons
- [[equatorial-guinea-macias]] - relationship: regional/thematic (African dictator; similar period; extreme brutality; post-colonial one-party state)
- [[uganda-amin]] - relationship: regional/temporal (African dictator; Cold War era; widespread killings)
- [[ethiopia-mengistu]] - relationship: thematic (African Marxist dictatorship; political terror; ethnic persecution)
- [[cambodia-khmer-rouge]] - relationship: thematic (revolutionary regime; mass killings; ideological purges; isolation)
- [[zaire-mobutu]] - relationship: regional/temporal (Central/West African dictator; Cold War era; contrasting ideology but similar duration)
- [[albania-hoxha]] - relationship: thematic (Stalinist one-party state; extreme isolation; purges)

## Confidence Assessment
**Overall**: Medium-High

**Notes**:
- **Well-documented**: Independence movement, break with France, Camp Boiro existence, key atrocities, death and coup
- **Death toll uncertainty**: Estimates range widely from 5,000 to 50,000+ at Camp Boiro; total regime deaths harder to establish
- **Exile figures**: 1.5-2 million commonly cited but difficult to verify precisely
- **Individual cases documented**: Diallo Telli, Achkar Marof, and other prominent victims have detailed records
- **Portuguese invasion**: Well-documented military operation with UN Security Council resolution confirming
- **Scholarly debate ongoing**: Assessment of Toure's legacy remains contested between revolutionary and tyrannical interpretations
- **Documentation gaps**: Many records destroyed; survivors' testimony limited by trauma and time; no formal truth commission
- **Ethnic persecution**: Pattern clear but precise numbers of Fulani victims not established
- **Recent scholarship**: Mike McGovern and others have contributed nuanced academic analysis
- **Living memory**: Survivors and diaspora communities preserve testimonies

## Classification

The classification of the Franco regime is contested among historians:

**Authoritarian Model (Juan Linz, 1964)**: Linz described Francoism as "authoritarian" rather than totalitarian, noting its "limited degree of political pluralism" due to conflicts between Francoist factions (Falangists, Carlists, monarchists, Catholic Church, military, technocrats). Unlike totalitarian regimes, Francoism relied on passive mass acceptance rather than popular mobilization.

**Fascist Classification**: Historians Paul Preston and Julian Casanova classify the regime as belonging to the family of European fascism. The Oxford Living Dictionary lists Franco's regime as an example of fascism.

**"Fascistized" Interpretation**: Some scholars argue the regime was not fully fascist but a "fascistized" conservative military dictatorship that incorporated fascist elements, particularly in its early phase (1939-1945), before evolving into a more conventional authoritarian regime during the Cold War.

**Current Consensus**: Most historians now recognize that Francoism underwent a "totalitarian or quasi-totalitarian, fascist or quasi-fascist" initial phase before becoming more conventionally authoritarian. The regime defies simple categorization due to its 36-year evolution.

## Pre-Conditions

### The Second Spanish Republic (1931-1939)

The Second Republic was established in 1931 after the abdication of King Alfonso XIII. It attempted democratic reforms and modernization but generated intense conflict:

**Political Instability**: Governments changed frequently after each election during 1931-1936. The ruling government was never stable, with constant shifts between left and right coalitions.

**Deep Polarization**: Spanish society split into two opposing camps:
- **Right/Nationalist**: Roman Catholics, military officers, landowners, businessmen, monarchists
- **Left/Republican**: Urban workers, agricultural laborers, educated middle class, anarchists, socialists, communists

**1936 Elections**: The left-wing Popular Front narrowly won the February 1936 elections. In the 36 hours following, 16 people were killed, 39 seriously injured, and 50 churches and 70 conservative political centers were attacked or set ablaze.

**Public Order Crisis**: Physical confrontations between leftists and rightists became routine. Many Cortes members carried arms. Major worker strikes and significant unemployment destabilized the country.

**Catalyst**: The murder of right-wing leader Jose Calvo Sotelo on July 13, 1936 served as the immediate trigger for the military uprising.

## Rise to Power

### The Military Coup (July 1936)

The Spanish Civil War began on July 17, 1936, when generals Emilio Mola and Francisco Franco launched an uprising against the democratically elected Republic. The initial coup only partially succeeded, leading to three years of civil war.

### The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)

**Foreign Intervention - Nationalist Side**:
- **Nazi Germany**: Sent the Condor Legion (approximately 5,000 air force personnel), provided training for ~56,000 Nationalist soldiers, supplied approximately 43 million pounds sterling worth of aid. Gestapo officer Paul Winzer helped organize the concentration camp system.
- **Fascist Italy**: Dispatched 60,000-70,000 troops as the Corps of Volunteer Troops (Corpo Truppe Volontarie), plus the Aviazione Legionaria air force. Approximately 6,000 Italians died in the conflict.

**Foreign Intervention - Republican Side**:
- **Soviet Union**: Despite signing the Non-Intervention Agreement, Stalin secretly provided 634-806 aircraft, 331-362 tanks, and 1,034-1,895 artillery pieces. Alexander Orlov of the NKVD supervised guerrilla operations, training approximately 14,000 operatives.
- **International Brigades**: 32,000-40,000 volunteers from over 50 countries, organized by the Communist International. Many were exiles from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and other authoritarian states.

**Non-Intervention Agreement**: Signed in August 1936 by France, Great Britain, Italy, Germany, and the USSR. Italy, Germany, and the USSR openly violated it.

**Nationalist Victory**: The war ended on April 1, 1939, with complete Nationalist victory. Franco was declared Generalisimo and Head of State.

## Methods of Control

### The Falange

The Falange Espanola Tradicionalista was merged with other conservative factions in 1937 to become the sole legal political party. Founded by Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera in 1933 as a fascist movement, it served as the regime's political arm. However:
- Franco was never a convinced Falangist but used the party instrumentally
- After Jose Antonio's execution by Republicans, Franco controlled the party completely
- From 1945 onwards, the Falange lost influence to the military, traditionalists, and technocrats
- Falange ministers never had great influence in government

### The Catholic Church (National Catholicism)

The Church was one of the three pillars of the regime (alongside the military and Falange):

- **Moral Legitimacy**: The Church provided Franco with domestic and international legitimacy, framing the Civil War as a "crusade"
- **Educational Control**: The Church controlled education and public morality
- **Social Surveillance**: Church personnel oversaw "total control" and "re-education" of Spaniards
- **Mandatory Participation**: Missing mass was frowned upon; religious participation was socially enforced
- **Censorship Enforcement**: The Church helped enforce censorship according to Catholic moral standards
- **Prison Discipline**: Church personnel played a disciplinary role in the prison system

### Censorship and Propaganda

- **1938 Press Law (Ley de Prensa)**: Placed all media under state supervision
- **Total Media Control**: Newspapers, books, radio, and films subject to heavy censorship
- **Subversive Material Banned**: Works critical of Franco or the Church were prohibited
- **Academic Purges**: Universities were purged of left-wing and non-conformist ideologies
- **Regional Language Suppression**: Catalan, Basque, and Galician banned from public use

### Secret Police and Surveillance

- **Servicio de Informacion Militar (SIM)**: Military intelligence monitored political activity
- **Police Surveillance**: Monitoring of universities, cultural groups, and even churches
- **Denunciation Networks**: Widespread use of informants
- **Fear and Intimidation**: Systematic use to suppress opposition

### Autarky (Economic Isolation)

**First Phase (1939-1959)**: Franco implemented autarky - economic self-sufficiency through state control of prices and industrial development within a protected national economy:

- **Devastating Results**: By the end of the 1940s, Spanish GDP was barely 40% of the average of Western European countries
- **Near-Famine Conditions**: The 1940s saw rise of black markets and rural misery
- **Migration**: Rural populations fled to urban shantytowns
- **National Income**: Fell back to 1900 levels

**Second Phase (1959-1975)**: The 1959 Stabilization Plan ended autarky:
- Technocrats (many from Opus Dei) replaced old Falangist guard
- Trade liberalization and foreign investment welcomed
- "Spanish Miracle": 7%+ growth rates, 1962-1966
- By 1975, Spain was the 9th largest economy in the world

## Key Events & Atrocities

### White Terror (During and After Civil War)

The White Terror refers to the systematic political violence by Nationalist forces:

**Death Toll Estimates**:
- **Paul Preston**: 130,199 is the "currently most reliable" figure for wartime executions, likely not less than 150,000; plus ~20,000 post-war executions; total of ~420,000 including war deaths
- **Gabriel Jackson & Antony Beevor**: 200,000 deaths (executions, hunger, illness in prisons) 1939-1943
- **Julian Casanova, Josep Fontana, Hugh Thomas**: ~150,000 total
- **Santos Julia**: ~100,000 wartime + ~40,000 post-war
- **Stanley G. Payne**: At least 70,000 wartime + ~28,000-30,000 post-war (more conservative)

**Regional Examples**:
- Malaga: ~17,000 summarily executed (one of harshest repressions)
- Cordoba: 4,000 executed
- Granada: 5,000 executed
- Seville: 3,028 executed
- Huelva: 2,000 killed + 2,500 disappeared

### Concentration Camps and Forced Labor

**Scale**: 200-300 concentration camps operated from 1936-1947. Half a million Spaniards and Europeans experienced the system.

**Batallones de Trabajadores (Workers' Battalions)**: Prisoners classified as "hostile" or "of questionable loyalty" were organized into forced labor battalions. At peak (early 1940), 108,781 forced laborers were working.

**Types of Work**: Reconstruction, coal mining, mercury extraction, highway construction, dam building, canal digging, and subcontracted labor for private companies.

**Conditions**: Historians agree conditions "were, in general, atrocious." Republican soldiers were not recognized as POWs, so the Geneva Convention did not apply.

**Nazi Involvement**: Some historians point to Gestapo officials as organizers of the camp system, particularly Paul Winzer.

### The Stolen Children (Ninos Robados)

**Origins**: The practice began in the 1930s as ideological cleansing - stripping left-wing parents of their children to eliminate "Marxist influence."

**Ideology**: Military psychiatrist Antonio Vallejo-Nagera ("the Spanish Mengele") argued that left-wing political beliefs could "intoxicate" children and "damage the mental health of future generations."

**Scale**: Estimates suggest up to 300,000 babies were abducted over the regime's duration. Judge Garzon cited 30,000 Republican children under Francoist "tutelage" between 1944-1954.

**Evolution**: In the 1950s, the practice expanded to target poor or "morally deficient" families. New mothers were often told their babies had died.

**Network**: Involved doctors, nurses, nuns, and priests. Children were placed with affluent, conservative, Catholic families.

**Duration**: The practice continued until 1987, well after Franco's death.

**First Trial**: In 2018, 85-year-old Dr. Eduardo Vela became the first person tried for the practice.

### Repression of Regional Identities

**Language Policies**: Spanish was declared the only official language. Catalan, Basque, and Galician were:
- Banned in administration
- Banned in schools (teachers who taught regional languages were punished)
- Confined to private spaces in the first decade
- Forbidden for naming newborns (from 1938)

**Basque Country**:
- Language and culture banned
- Institutions and political organizations abolished
- Thousands of Basques forced into exile (usually to Latin America or France)
- The 1937 bombing of Guernica by the Condor Legion became a symbol of repression

**Catalan Identity**: Catalan language banned from public spaces; Spanish made the sole language of public life.

**Unintended Consequences**: The repression inadvertently strengthened regional identities and contributed to the formation of ETA (1959) and other nationalist movements.

### WWII Stance

**Official Position**: Spain was officially "non-belligerent" until October 1943, then formally neutral. But in practice:

**Pro-Axis Alignment**:
- Franco and his government openly sympathized with Hitler and Mussolini
- Spain signed the Anti-Comintern Pact (November 25, 1941)
- Allowed German submarines to refuel in Spanish ports
- Supplied Germany with tungsten and other strategic materials

**The Hendaye Meeting (October 23, 1940)**: Franco met Hitler at the Spanish-French border to discuss Spain joining the Axis. Franco demanded:
- Gibraltar
- French Morocco and part of French Algeria
- French Cameroon
- Large quantities of food, petrol, and arms

Hitler found the demands extortionate and later told Mussolini: "I prefer to have three or four of my own teeth pulled out than to speak to that man again!"

**The Blue Division (Division Azul)**:
- Officially the 250th Infantry Division of the German Army
- Spanish volunteers who fought on the Eastern Front (1941-1943)
- Notably served at the Siege of Leningrad and Battle of Krasny Bor
- Hitler awarded the division its own medal, calling them "equal to the best German ones"
- Franco withdrew the division in November 1943 under Allied pressure

**Post-War Isolation**: Spain was excluded from the newly created United Nations and remained isolated until the mid-1950s.

## Opposition & Resistance

### During the Regime

- **Maquis**: Republican guerrillas continued armed resistance until the early 1950s
- **Communist Party (PCE)**: Operated clandestinely throughout
- **ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna)**: Founded 1959, began armed struggle for Basque independence
- **Workers' Movements**: Despite banned unions, labor strikes occurred, especially from 1960s onward
- **Student Movements**: University protests increased in the 1960s-70s
- **Catholic Opposition**: Parts of the Church became critical, especially after Vatican II

### Fate of Opposition

- Imprisonment (hundreds of thousands detained)
- Execution
- Exile (hundreds of thousands fled to France, Latin America)
- Torture
- Forced labor
- Loss of property and livelihood

## Fall / End

### Franco's Death (November 20, 1975)

Franco's health began declining in the early 1970s. In October 1975:
- October 30: Permanently transferred duties to Juan Carlos
- November 3: Fell into coma from gastrointestinal bleeding
- November 7: Transferred to La Paz hospital
- Multiple surgeries resulted in removal of most of his stomach
- Acute peritonitis led to multiple organ failure
- November 19: Clinically dead
- November 20: Family agreed to disconnect life support; death announced

### Succession

In 1969, Franco had designated Prince Juan Carlos (grandson of Alfonso XIII) as his official successor, bypassing Juan Carlos's father. As a condition, Juan Carlos swore loyalty to Franco's Movimiento Nacional.

Two days after Franco's death, the Cortes proclaimed Juan Carlos I King of Spain. He was expected to continue Francoism but instead initiated democratic reforms.

## Aftermath

### Transition to Democracy (1975-1982)

**Key Developments**:
- July 1976: King Juan Carlos appointed reformist Adolfo Suarez as Head of Government
- June 1977: First democratic elections since 1936
- December 1978: New Constitution approved by referendum, establishing parliamentary democracy under constitutional monarchy
- February 1981: Juan Carlos played crucial role in preventing a coup attempt (23-F)
- October 1982: Socialist Party (PSOE) victory marked the end of the transition

### The Pact of Forgetting (Pacto del Olvido)

An informal agreement between left and right parties to avoid direct confrontation with the Francoist legacy:
- No prosecutions for human rights violations
- No bureaucratic purges of Francoist officials
- No formal condemnation of the Franco regime
- No truth commissions
- Francoist monuments left standing

### The 1977 Amnesty Law

Passed October 15, 1977:
- Freed political prisoners
- Permitted exiles to return
- Guaranteed impunity for Civil War and Francoist crimes
- Still in force today
- Repeatedly criticized by the UN (2012, 2013) as violating international law on crimes against humanity

### Later Reckoning

**2000**: Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (ARMH) established

**2007 Historical Memory Law**: Under Zapatero's government:
- Formally condemned Francoist repressions
- Granted rights to victims and descendants
- Earmarked funding for exhumations (by NGOs, not government)
- Criticized for "privatization" of exhumations

**2010 Garzon Controversy**: Judge Baltasar Garzon attempted to investigate Francoist crimes, arguing crimes against humanity are not subject to the amnesty law. He was charged with abuse of power (later cleared), but his investigations were discontinued.

**2011-2018**: Conservative PP government cut funding for Historical Memory Law

**2022 Democratic Memory Law**: Under Sanchez government:
- Government made responsible for exhuming and identifying victims
- Official register of victims created
- Remaining Francoist symbols ordered removed

### Mass Graves

- Estimated 3,500 mass graves across Spain
- Over 2,000 identified (more than 600 in Andalusia alone)
- Only ~800 exhumed in two decades
- Largest: San Rafael cemetery, Malaga (perhaps 4,000+ bodies)
- ARMH estimates over 35,000 "disappeared" remain in mass graves
- Many graves destroyed by construction (highways, industrial parks, neighborhoods)

## Scholarly Debate

### Was Franco Fascist?

**Fascist Interpretation** (Preston, Casanova): The regime belongs to European fascism, particularly in its early phase. Franco's personal beliefs were "deeply conservative" shaped by colonial military mentality.

**Authoritarian Interpretation** (Linz): The regime was authoritarian but not fascist/totalitarian due to limited pluralism and lack of mobilizing ideology.

**Evolving Interpretation** (Current consensus): The regime underwent a fascist or quasi-fascist early phase before evolving into conventional authoritarianism. Some use terms like "para-fascist" or "unfinished fascistization."

### Death Toll Controversies

Estimates vary widely due to:
- Incomplete records
- Regional variations in documentation
- Different methodologies
- Political sensitivities in Spain

Conservative estimates (Payne): ~100,000 total executions
Higher estimates (Preston): ~170,000+ executions; ~420,000 total deaths attributable to Franco

Notably, Payne criticized Preston for downplaying Republican atrocities but also said Preston's post-war execution estimate was probably too low.

### Spanish Transition: Model or Impunity?

**Positive View**: The "Spanish model" of transition is sometimes praised as a successful peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.

**Critical View**: Critics argue the Pact of Forgetting and 1977 Amnesty Law institutionalized impunity, equating "victims and victimizers" and leaving justice unserved for decades.

### Exhumations Debate

**For Exhumations**:
- Basic human right for families to recover and properly bury their dead
- Historical truth and acknowledgment
- End to "second victimization" of Republican families

**Against/Resistant**:
- "Reopening old wounds" (PP, Vox)
- Fear of destabilizing national reconciliation
- Preference for "moving forward"

The 2022 Democratic Memory Law attempts to resolve this by making exhumations a government responsibility.

## Confidence Assessment
**Overall**: Medium-High

**Well-Documented**:
- Basic chronology and political structure
- Foreign intervention in Civil War
- Methods of control
- Transition to democracy
- 1977 Amnesty Law and Pact of Forgetting

**Moderately Documented**:
- Regional repression details
- Concentration camp system
- Stolen children (documentation ongoing)

**Uncertain/Debated**:
- Exact death toll figures (estimates vary by 100,000+)
- Regime classification (fascist vs. authoritarian)
- Number of mass grave victims
- Full extent of stolen children practice

**Notes**: Death toll estimates remain highly contested, ranging from ~100,000 (conservative estimates) to 420,000+ (Preston's comprehensive figures including all attributable deaths). The ongoing exhumation of mass graves continues to add to historical documentation. Spain's relatively recent engagement with historical memory (post-2000) means new research continues to emerge.

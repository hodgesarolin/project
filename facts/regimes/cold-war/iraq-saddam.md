## Classification

### Regime Type Debate

Scholars debate whether Saddam's Iraq should be classified as **authoritarian** or **totalitarian**:

**Authoritarian View (Joseph Sassoon)**:
- Regime did not attempt full state control over economy (unlike Soviet model)
- Used mixed economy to distribute rewards and punishments
- "A demonic machine to keep people down rather than determine what they believed"

**Totalitarian View (Aaron Faust)**:
- Regime attempted to enforce active support from all Iraqis
- Politicized and mobilized citizens rather than simply demobilizing them
- Drew comparisons to Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia
- Totalitarianism as ruling strategy, not just outcome

**Key Totalitarian Features**:
- Official Ba'athist ideology demanding adherence
- Single-party state led by one person
- Extensive surveillance network
- Terror apparatus and secret police
- Monopoly over mass communication
- Personality cult
- Centralized (though not fully command) economy

**Distinguishing Characteristics**:
- Increasing intensity of punishment for transgressions
- Collective punishment for individual acts of resistance
- Attempted total party penetration of society (1.2 million members by late 1970s from 5,000 in 1968)

3. Townspeople herded into army trucks, taken to holding facilities
4. At camps (largest: Topzawa near Kirkuk), men and boys separated from women, elderly, children
5. Men and boys taken to remote sites and executed in groups

### Chemical Weapons Use
- 40+ documented attacks between April 1987 and August 1988

## Marsh Arabs Persecution

### Background
- Mesopotamian Marshes: ~20,000 km² wetlands in Tigris-Euphrates system
- Marsh Arabs (Ahwaris/Ma'dan): Indigenous population, ~500,000 in 1950s; ~250,000 in 1991
- Predominantly Shia Muslims
- By mid-1980s: marshes became refuge for those persecuted by regime

### 1991 Uprising and Retaliation
- After Gulf War, Shias in south rebelled against Saddam
- Many took refuge in marshes
- When rebellion couldn't be crushed, Saddam ordered marshes drained

### Methods of Persecution
- Dammed water sources feeding wetlands
- Blocked distributary streams from Tigris with embankments
- Water discharged into "Glory Canal"
- Villages attacked and burned
- Land and water mines laid
- Reports of water deliberately poisoned
- Chemical attacks on population
- Propaganda campaign against Ma'dan people

### Scale of Destruction
- By 1993: Two-thirds of Central Marshes lost
- By 2000: 90% of marshlands disappeared (NASA satellite imagery)
- UN called it "one of the world's greatest environmental disasters"

### Human Toll
- 200,000+ forced from homes
- Several thousand killed
- Population fell from 250,000 (1991) to fewer than 40,000 in ancestral homeland

- Lack of political will to respond

### Recovery
- After 2003: local communities breached dikes
- Four-year drought ended same year
- Marshes experienced substantial recovery
- Now cover 50%+ of 1970s levels

---

## Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988)

### Causes
- Historical tensions over Shatt al-Arab waterway (Tigris-Euphrates confluence)
- 1975 Algiers Agreement: Iraq ceded partial control of waterway in exchange for Iran ending support for Kurdish insurgency
- 1979 Iranian Revolution: Saddam perceived threat from Shia theocracy
- Fear of revolutionary Islam spreading to Iraq's Shia majority
- Opportunity to exploit Iran's post-revolutionary instability
- Goal: capture Arab-majority Khuzestan province; establish regional dominance

### The War
- **Start**: September 22, 1980—Iraqi invasion of western Iran
- **Duration**: 8 years
- **End**: August 1988—Iran accepted UN Security Council Resolution 598

### Casualties
- **Total**: 1-2 million (both sides)
- **Deaths**: ~500,000 (both sides); Iran suffered greatest losses
- **Iraqi casualties**: ~500,000 (military and civilian)
- **Iran's total costs**: 1.5 million casualties; $350 billion

### War's End
- Iran accepted ceasefire, exhausted and fearing chemical attacks on major cities
- Stalemate—no territorial changes
- Iraq emerged with massive debt ($37 billion to Gulf states)

---

## Kuwait Invasion & Gulf War

### Invasion of Kuwait (August 2, 1990)

**Causes**:
1. **Debt**: $37 billion owed to Gulf creditors from Iran-Iraq War
2. **Oil disputes**: Kuwait accused of slant-drilling into Iraq's Rumaila oil field
3. **Oil prices**: Kuwait's production above OPEC quota kept Iraq's revenues down
4. **Territorial claims**: Historical argument that Kuwait was part of Iraq
5. **Strategic goals**: Control 20% of world's oil reserves; gain substantial Persian Gulf coastline

**The Invasion**:
- Four elite Republican Guard divisions and special forces

- Within two weeks: most cities and provinces fell to rebels

### Suppression
**Methods**:
- Helicopters (permitted under ceasefire terms)
- Long-range artillery

### Oil-for-Food Programme (1995-2003)
- Created April 1995 (Resolution 986); implemented May 1996
- Permitted Iraq to sell $2 billion oil every six months
- Two-thirds used for humanitarian needs

**Achievements**:
- Food basket nutritional value nearly doubled (1,200 to 2,200 calories/person/day)
- Communicable diseases reduced
- Electricity and potable water improved

**Continued Suffering**:
- Programme could not fully address humanitarian crisis

### Scholarly Debate on Responsibility
- Some argue Saddam's mismanagement of aid caused deaths
- Kurdish region (also sanctioned but UN-administered) fared better
- Others hold sanctions themselves primarily responsible
- Described as potentially "worst humanitarian catastrophe ever imposed in the name of global governance"

---

## Scholarly Debate

### Classification Debate

**Authoritarian vs. Totalitarian** (see Classification section above)

Key scholars:
- **Joseph Sassoon**: *Saddam Hussein's Ba'th Party: Inside an Authoritarian Regime* (2012)
- **Aaron M. Faust**: *The Ba'thification of Iraq: Saddam Hussein's Totalitarianism* (2015)

Both used newly available Ba'ath Party archives.

### Death Toll Debates

**Direct State Violence**:
- Human Rights Watch: 250,000-290,000 murdered or disappeared
- Some estimates reach 500,000+
- 250+ mass graves documented

**Anfal Campaign**:
- HRW: 50,000-100,000
- Kurdish officials: up to 182,000

**Sanctions-Related Deaths**:
- Range from 227,000-500,000 excess child deaths
- Debate over attribution (sanctions vs. regime policy)
- Recent scholarship questions higher estimates

### Historiographical Issues
- Opening of Ba'ath Party archives provides unprecedented access
- Regime deliberately destroyed some records
- Many witnesses killed or fled
- Iraqi government Martyrs' Foundation continues documentation

### Comparative Framework
- Comparisons drawn to: Nazi Germany, Stalinist USSR, Hafez al-Assad's Syria
- Questions of genocide recognition for various campaigns
- Debate over whether Iraq represents unique authoritarian type

---

## Comparisons

### Regional Parallels
- [[syria-assad]]: Fellow Ba'athist regime; Assad family rule; similar security apparatus; use of chemical weapons against population
- Both regimes: minority-dominated (Sunni in Iraq; Alawite in Syria); single-party states; personality cults; brutal suppression of uprisings

### Broader Comparative Context
- **Totalitarian parallels**: extensive surveillance, party penetration of society, personality cult
- **Differences from classic totalitarianism**: mixed economy, not full command economy
- **Regional authoritarian type**: combines Arab nationalism, Ba'athist ideology, family/tribal networks

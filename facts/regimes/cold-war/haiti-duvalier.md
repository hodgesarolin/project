## Pre-Conditions

### Historical Context: Haiti's Political Instability
Haiti had a long history of political instability since independence in 1804. The country experienced:
- Frequent coups and governmental changes
- Deep divisions between the mulatto (mixed-race) elite and black majority
- U.S. occupation from 1915 to 1934 that centralized state power
- Chronic poverty as the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere

### The Magloire Era and Its Collapse (1950-1956)
Colonel Paul Magloire seized power in a bloodless coup in 1950 and ruled until 1956. His regime was characterized by:
- Initial economic growth and infrastructure development
- Growing corruption and authoritarianism
- Loss of popular support due to mishandling of Hurricane Hazel relief (1954)
- Forced resignation in December 1956 amid protests and strikes

### Political Vacuum (1956-1957)
After Magloire's departure, Haiti experienced a period of chaos:
- Four provisional governments in nine months
- Military interventions and factional struggles
- Growing demand for populist, black nationalist leadership
- Multiple candidates vied for power in the 1957 election

### Duvalier's Background
Francois Duvalier positioned himself as the heir to the reformist legacy of Dumarsais Estime (1946-1950):
- Earned medical degree from University of Haiti (1934)
- Studied public health at University of Michigan
- Worked on campaigns against yaws and other tropical diseases, earning nickname "Papa Doc"
- Served as Minister of Public Health and Labor under Estime
- Co-founded the journal *Les Griots*, promoting Negritude and black nationalism
- Went into hiding during Magloire's rule

---

## Rise to Power

### The 1957 Election
Duvalier ran on a populist, black nationalist platform:
- Presented himself as champion of the black majority against the mulatto elite
- Claimed the mantle of Estime's reformism
- Cultivated image as humble country doctor
- Army support proved decisive; military leaders saw him as malleable

**September 22, 1957**: Duvalier won the election with army backing, though the vote was widely considered fraudulent.

### Consolidation of Power (1957-1964)

**July 1958 Coup Attempt**:
- Haitian exiles and military officers attempted to overthrow Duvalier
- Failed coup provided pretext for massive purge of military
- Duvalier reduced army size and replaced officers with loyalists

**Creation of the Tonton Macoutes (1959)**:
- Formally established as Milice de Volontaires de la Securite Nationale (MVSN)
- Renamed Volontaires de la Securite Nationale (VSN) in 1970
- Personal militia outside military chain of command
- Answered directly to Duvalier
- Grew to approximately 9,000-15,000 members

**1961 "Re-election"**:
- Duvalier held fraudulent election where he was the only candidate
- Official tally: 1,320,748 votes to 0
- Extended his term by manipulating constitutional provisions

**1964 Declaration as President-for-Life**:
- Constitutional referendum declared him President-for-Life
- Official vote: 99.9% approval
- Solidified absolute personal control

### U.S. Relations During Rise
- United States initially welcomed Duvalier's election in 1957
- Haiti received $70 million in U.S. economic assistance between 1945-1960
- Geographic proximity to Cuba made Haiti strategically important after 1959 Cuban Revolution
- Despite concerns about repression, Cold War imperatives shaped U.S. policy

## Methods of Control

### The Tonton Macoutes (Volunteers for National Security)

**Origins and Name**:
The name derives from Haitian Creole folklore. "Tonton Macoute" (Uncle Gunnysack) was a mythological bogeyman who kidnapped misbehaving children in a straw sack and ate them for breakfast.

**Structure and Operations**:
- Not a formal military force; members were unpaid "volunteers"
- Received license to extort, steal, and terrorize in lieu of salary
- Wore distinctive blue denim uniforms, dark glasses, and carried machetes
- Operated outside legal constraints
- Network of informants throughout society
- Estimated 9,000-15,000 members at peak

**Methods**:
- Summary executions, often public and brutal
- Torture of political opponents
- Stoning and burning people alive
- Displaying corpses in public as warnings
- Sexual violence
- Extortion of businesses and citizens
- Confiscation of peasant land

**Leadership**:
- Clement Barbot (1959-1963): First commander; later turned against Duvalier and was killed
- Luckner Cambronne (1960s-1972): Most notorious leader; known as "Vampire of the Caribbean"
- Roger Lafontant (1972-1986): Final major leader under Baby Doc

### Fort Dimanche Prison

**History**:
Built in 1804 by the French, Fort Dimanche became the regime's primary torture and execution center.

**Conditions**:
- Individual cells: 7 feet long, 7 feet high, 3 feet wide
- Communal cells: 3 meters by 3 meters holding up to 15 prisoners
- No ventilation; harsh electric lights burning constantly
- Prisoners forced to drink water when hosed down once weekly
- Gruel placed on floor for food
- Dead bodies often left for days before removal

**Death Toll**:
- Estimated 3,000 inmates died at Fort Dimanche
- Amnesty International estimated 1 in 10 prisoners died within first days
- 8 in 10 did not survive more than two years

**Torture Methods**:
- Prolonged standing while handcuffed facing walls
- Severe beatings
- Electric shock
- Starvation
- Psychological torture

**"Triangle of Death"**:
Three prisons formed the regime's detention network:
1. Fort Dimanche
2. Casernes Dessalines (on presidential palace grounds)
3. National Penitentiary

### Cult of Personality and Vodou

**Baron Samedi Imagery**:
Papa Doc deliberately modeled his appearance on Baron Samedi, the Vodou spirit (lwa) of the dead:
- Black suit and bowler hat
- Dark glasses
- Deepened nasal voice
- Cultivated aura of supernatural power

After a 1959 heart attack and nine-hour coma, Duvalier intensified his Vodou mystique, presenting himself as a powerful spirit or lwa.

**Propaganda**:
- Regime materials declared "Papa Doc was one with the lwa, Jesus Christ and God himself"
- Famous propaganda image showed Jesus Christ with hand on Duvalier's shoulder
- Caption: "I have chosen him"
- Required picture of Duvalier in every home, school, and business

**Religious Manipulation**:
- Employed Vodou priests (houngans) in intelligence networks
- Replaced Catholicism with Vodou as de facto state religion
- Excommunicated by Catholic Church in 1961 for expelling foreign bishops
- Appointed Vodou priest to cabinet position

**Example of Supernatural Terror**:
When searching for Clement Barbot in 1963, Duvalier was told Barbot had transformed into a black dog. He ordered all black dogs in Haiti killed.

### Media Control and Censorship

**Suppression of Press**:
- Independent newspapers shut down
- Radio stations closed or brought under regime control
- Journalists imprisoned, exiled, or killed
- Foreign correspondents expelled

**State Media**:
- Regime controlled all broadcast media
- Constant propaganda glorifying Duvalier
- Dissent impossible through official channels

### Economic Policies and Kleptocracy

**Systematic Looting**:
- Papa Doc's regime confiscated $500 million in taxes and foreign aid
- Baby Doc estimated to have stolen $300-900 million
- State monopolies (tobacco, etc.) served as personal piggy banks
- International aid routinely diverted

**Impact on Population**:
- Malnutrition and famine became endemic
- Healthcare and education systems collapsed
- Haiti remained poorest country in Western Hemisphere
- Poverty far exceeded any other nation in the Americas

**Brain Drain**:
- Thousands of professionals fled repression
- At one point, more Haitian doctors in Canada than in Haiti
- Teachers, engineers, and intellectuals emigrated
- Estimated 70% of skilled workers still live abroad today
- Educational and healthcare systems never recovered

## Key Events & Atrocities

### The Clement Barbot Affair (1963)

**Background**:
Clement Barbot, the founder and first leader of the Tonton Macoutes, was trusted to run the government during Papa Doc's 1959 heart attack recovery. Upon returning to power, Duvalier suspected Barbot of disloyalty and imprisoned him.

**Events**:
- April 1963: Barbot released from prison
- Barbot began plotting to kidnap Duvalier's children
- Plot discovered; nationwide manhunt launched
- July 14, 1963: Barbot and his brother Harry found hiding near Port-au-Prince
- Field set ablaze; brothers shot while fleeing

**Significance**:
Demonstrated that even regime insiders were not safe from Duvalier's paranoia.

### Jeune Haiti Invasion and Jeremie Vespers (1964)

**The Invasion**:
- August 5-6, 1964: Thirteen young Haitian exiles calling themselves "Jeune Haiti" (Young Haiti) landed near Dame-Marie
- Goal: Overthrow Duvalier regime
- Despite small numbers, they achieved some military success, even downing a Haitian military plane
- Over three months, eleven were killed in combat
- Final two survivors (Marcel Numa and Louis Drouin) captured and publicly executed; execution was televised

**The Jeremie Vespers Massacre**:
Several Jeune Haiti members were from the town of Jeremie. The regime ordered collective punishment:
- Between August and October 1964, at least 27 people murdered
- Victims ranged from age 2 to 85
- Tonton Macoutes targeted family members of rebels
- Sansaricq and Drouin families nearly wiped out
- True death toll may be in the hundreds
- Many others imprisoned, raped, tortured, or expelled
- Named after the medieval Sicilian Vespers massacre

**Impact**:
"Almost the entire elite of the city was wiped out overnight. Jeremie became like a body without a soul."

### Mass Executions and Summary Killings

Throughout both Duvalier regimes, the Tonton Macoutes carried out systematic violence:
- Political opponents disappeared overnight
- Public executions meant to terrorize
- Corpses displayed in trees and public spaces
- Family members who tried to retrieve bodies also disappeared

**Documented Executions**:
- August 7, 1974: Summary execution of prisoners at Fort Dimanche
- March 25, 1976: Seven people executed
- September 21, 1977: Eight prisoners executed at Morne Christophe and Titanyen

### The Blood Plasma Trade

Luckner Cambronne operated the Hemo-Caribbean plasma center (1971-1972):
- Exported 5,000-6,000 liters of plasma monthly to U.S.
- Poor hygiene standards
- Bought cadavers from General Hospital for $3 each to sell to American medical schools
- Suspicions that some "cadavers" were killed specifically for export
- Center may have contributed to early HIV/AIDS spread (according to some epidemiological research)

### Death Toll Estimates

Estimates vary significantly depending on source:

| Source | Estimate | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Human Rights Watch | 20,000-30,000 | Conservative estimate for both regimes |
| Historians (consensus) | ~30,000 | Most commonly cited figure |
| Papa Doc alone | 30,000-50,000 | Higher estimates for 1957-1971 period |
| Christian Science Monitor | 60,000 | Combined 1957-1986 toll |
| Fort Dimanche deaths | ~3,000 | Single prison alone |

**Context**:
- Total number who died from torture, starvation, and execution in prisons remains unknown
- Hundreds of thousands fled into exile
- Death toll figures do not capture full scope of suffering

## U.S. Relations

### Eisenhower Administration (1957-1961)
- Initially welcomed Duvalier's election
- Haiti viewed as strategically unimportant before Cuban Revolution
- Aid continued despite growing repression

### Kennedy Administration (1961-1963)

**Alliance for Progress**:
- Kennedy pledged to build "prosperous, progressive, and democratic nations"
- Haiti received $15 million in economic aid in 1961

**Growing Tensions**:
- Kennedy "particularly disturbed" by Duvalier's repression
- Allegations of aid misappropriation
- U.S. halted most economic assistance mid-1962
- Duvalier refused to comply with stricter accounting procedures
- Kennedy took "special interest" in Haiti, frustrated by inability to influence Duvalier

**Cold War Constraints**:
- Despite displeasure, fear of communism led to "laissez-faire approach"
- Duvalier threatened to turn to Castro and Communist bloc if aid cut
- U.S. consorted with Haitian exile groups planning to overthrow Duvalier

### Johnson Administration (1963-1969)

**Policy Shift**:
- After Kennedy's assassination, U.S. "eased pressure on Duvalier"
- Grudgingly accepted him as "bulwark against communism"
- Economic aid restored (~$15 million between 1964-1968)
- Policy became "not rocking the boat"

**Cold War Rationale**:
"The Haitian dictator was a Western ally in the Cold War, and U.S. intelligence believed that Castro or Haitian Communists could benefit from his removal."

### Nixon and Ford Administrations (1969-1977)
- Continued quiet support for anti-communist alignment
- Limited public criticism of human rights abuses
- U.S. policy of containment led to silence on Duvalier abuses

### Carter Administration (1977-1981)

- Jean-Claude made cosmetic reforms
- Released some political prisoners
- Eased press censorship slightly

### Reagan Administration (1981-1986)

---

## Fall / End

### Baby Doc's Rule (1971-1986)

**Succession**:
- April 21, 1971: Papa Doc died of heart disease and diabetes at age 64

- Initially, real power held by his mother Simone and advisors

**Cosmetic Reforms**:
- Released some political prisoners
- Eased press censorship slightly
- Replaced some older cabinet members
- U.S. pressure prompted limited changes

**Continued Repression**:
- "No sharp changes from previous policies occurred"
- Political opposition still not tolerated
- Tonton Macoutes remained active
- Fort Dimanche continued operations

**The Michele Bennett Marriage (1980)**:
- Jean-Claude married light-skinned divorcee Michele Bennett
- $2 million state-funded wedding amid mass poverty
- Mother Simone and old guard fiercely opposed the marriage
- Jean-Claude seized control from his mother
- Michele's influence accelerated corruption and extravagance

**Economic Deterioration**:
- Regime systematically looted state resources
- Poverty deepened
- International criticism of human rights grew
- Economic crisis mounted

### Popular Uprising (1984-1986)

**Initial Protests**:
- May 1984: Food riots began in Gonaives
- October 1985-January 1986: Protests spread to six other cities including Cap-Haitien
- Demonstrations and raids on food warehouses

**Regime Response**:
- 10% cut in staple food prices
- Closed independent radio stations
- Cabinet reshuffles
- Police and army crackdowns
- None of these measures stopped the momentum

**Collapse**:
- General strike called by democratic opposition
- Violence spread to Port-au-Prince
- February 5, 1986: Military confronted Duvalier and demanded departure
- No support left from military or legislature

### Departure (February 7, 1986)

**The Exit**:
- Duvalier and family departed on U.S. Air Force plane
- Fled to France
- Before leaving, established six-member National Council of Government (CNG) under Army Commander Henri Namphy

**False Start**:
On January 30, 1986, Duvalier initially accepted departure. Reagan even announced he was leaving. However, his motorcade was blocked by gunfire en route to the airport. Duvalier returned to the palace and declared: "We are as firm as a monkey's tail."

**Final Departure**:
U.S. State Department cut aid; violence spread. With no remaining support, Duvalier finally left on February 7, 1986.

---

## Aftermath

### Immediate Post-Duvalier Period

**National Council of Government (CNG)**:
- Military-led transitional government
- Many Duvalierists remained in power
- Tonton Macoutes still operating
- Violent reprisals against Macoutes by population ("dechoukaj" or uprooting)

**Constitutional Referendum (1987)**:
- New constitution approved with 99% vote
- Many saw U.S. military advisors as effort to control transition

**Continuing Instability**:
- Haiti experienced multiple short-lived interim governments
- Military coups continued
- Violence and human rights violations persisted

### Democratic Attempts

**1990 Election**:
- Jean-Bertrand Aristide, former Catholic priest, elected president
- First democratic election in Haitian history
- Champion of the poor

**1991 Coup**:
- Military overthrew Aristide after less than a year
- Pattern of instability continued for decades

### Jean-Claude Duvalier's Return and Death

**Exile in France (1986-2011)**:
- Lived lavishly initially; residence outside Paris, villa on French Riviera
- Divorced Michele Bennett in 1990
- Eventually lived in relative poverty
- Not granted formal asylum; confined to 30-mile radius in southern France

**Return to Haiti (January 16, 2011)**:

- "Duvalier's death robs Haiti of what could have been the most important human rights trial in its history" - Reed Brody, Human Rights Watch

### Financial Recovery Efforts

**Scale of Theft**:
- U.S. accounting firm determined at least $300 million stolen (conservative estimate)
- Other estimates up to $900 million
- Much hidden in Swiss, French, and U.S. accounts

**Legal Actions**:
- 1998 Florida civil case: $504 million judgment against Duvalier (never recovered)
- 2010: Swiss government froze $4.6 million in accounts
- 2013: Swiss court upheld asset freeze, ruling assets obtained illicitly

**Current Status**:
Most stolen funds never recovered.

### Long-term Legacy

**Economic Impact**:
- Haiti remains poorest country in Western Hemisphere

- Remittances ($1.5-1.8 billion annually) became largest source of national income
- Infrastructure, education, and healthcare never recovered

**Political Culture**:
- Legacy of state violence created culture of impunity
- Political actors often evade consequences
- Frequent changes in leadership, political violence, and electoral disputes
- Democratic governance remains fragile

**Comparative Trajectory**:
Contrast with Dominican Republic illustrates impact:
- 50 years ago, DR was ~25% richer than Haiti
- Today, DR is six times richer than Haiti
- DR emerged from Trujillo dictatorship with more investment in education and infrastructure

## Scholarly Debate

### Duvalierism as a Political System

**Michel-Rolph Trouillot's Analysis** (*Haiti: State Against Nation*, 1990):
Key scholarly work on the regime. Trouillot argues:
- Duvalierism not merely personal evil but structural phenomenon
- Grew from contradictions of peripheral state
- Regime used rhetoric of "national unity" coupled with unbridled violence
- Peasantry exploited as productive class from which state extracted value
- U.S. occupation (1915-1934) created centralized state that enabled Duvalier's rise

Trouillot (who fled Haiti in 1968 as student activist) wrote: "In the euphoria that followed the departure of Haiti's hated dictator...most analysts treated the regimes of the two Duvaliers as a historical nightmare created by the malevolent minds of the leaders. Yet the crisis...did not begin with the dictatorship, and is far from being solved."

**Bernard Diederich's Documentation**:
Journalist who lived in Haiti for 14 years; wrote *Papa Doc: Haiti and its Dictator* (1969) and *Murderers Among Us*.
Graham Greene wrote: "No one alive...is better qualified than Bernard Diederich to tell the horrifying story of Haiti under the rule of Dr. Francois Duvalier."

**Jean-Philippe Belleau's Work** (*Killing the Elites: Haiti, 1964*):
Academic analysis focusing on Jeremie Vespers massacre; examines processes of victimization and targeting of elite.

### Kleptocracy vs. Totalitarianism

**Regime Type Debate**:
- Some scholars argue Duvalier regime was classic kleptocracy focused on personal enrichment
- Others emphasize totalitarian control through terror
- Consensus: Lacked bureaucratic capacity for total population control, but achieved near-total political suppression

**Comparison with Other Kleptocrats**:
Harvard studies compare Duvaliers with Trujillo (Dominican Republic) and Mobutu (Zaire/Congo):
- All were "true kleptocrats" with primary aim of personal wealth accumulation
- None had extensive base of popular support
- Key difference: Trujillo invested in infrastructure/education to increase taxable wealth; Duvaliers engaged in "extensive plundering" with minimal investment

### Role of Vodou

**Scholarly Perspectives**:
- Patrick Bellegarde-Smith (*Haiti: The Breached Citadel*, 1990) analyzes Vodou's role in understanding Haitian political culture
- Duvalier's manipulation of Vodou represents unique authoritarian technique
- Debate over whether Vodou imagery reflected genuine belief or cynical manipulation

### Cold War Complicity

**U.S. Responsibility Debate**:
- U.S. supported Duvaliers as anti-communist allies despite known atrocities
- Policy of containment led to silence on human rights abuses
- Some argue U.S. bears significant moral responsibility
- Others emphasize limits of U.S. influence over Duvalier

## Comparisons
- [[chile-pinochet]] — relationship: temporal (Cold War U.S.-supported dictator; different methods but similar impunity)
- [[dominican-republic-trujillo]] — relationship: geographic/temporal (neighboring Hispaniola dictatorship; both used terror but Trujillo invested more in development)
- [[congo-mobutu]] — relationship: thematic (Cold War kleptocracy; similar U.S. support; massive embezzlement)
- [[philippines-marcos]] — relationship: thematic (Cold War kleptocracy; family dynasty; similar U.S. support and exile)
- [[nicaragua-somoza]] — relationship: temporal (Cold War family dynasty; U.S.-backed dictatorship)

## Confidence Assessment
**Overall**: Medium-High

**Notes**:
- Death toll estimates vary significantly (20,000-60,000); range reflects genuine uncertainty in historical record
- Regime's own lack of documentation and destruction of records limits precision
- Key events (Jeremie Vespers, Fort Dimanche) well-documented through survivor testimony and investigations
- U.S. involvement documented through declassified State Department records
- Financial crimes documented through court proceedings and Swiss investigations
- Scholarly consensus exists on general characterization but details contested
- Some atrocities may never be fully documented due to destroyed records and deceased witnesses
- Baby Doc's death before trial prevented full accounting
- Vodou aspects rely partly on regime propaganda and may be exaggerated

**Areas of Higher Confidence**:
- Tonton Macoutes structure and methods
- U.S. Cold War policy toward Haiti
- Financial corruption scale
- Major events and timeline

**Areas of Lower Confidence**:
- Precise death tolls
- Full extent of Papa Doc's personal involvement in specific atrocities
- Complete accounting of stolen assets

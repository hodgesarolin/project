## Political System

### Revolutionary Command Council (1952-1956)

### Arab Socialist Union Structure
- Founded 1962 under National Charter

## Ideology: Pan-Arabism and Nasserism

### Core Tenets
- **Arab Nationalism**: Arabs constitute a single nation artificially divided by colonialism
- **Pan-Arabism**: Goal of unifying all Arab states from Atlantic to Arabian Sea
- **Anti-Imperialism**: Opposition to Western interference in Arab affairs
- **Arab Socialism**: State-led economic development, nationalization, land reform

- Voice of the Arabs radio broadcast Nasserist message across Middle East
- Inspired military coups and revolutionary movements in Iraq (1958), Syria, Libya (1969), Algeria
- Egypt established "template for military republics" copied across Arab world

### Conflict with Islamism
- Nasserism's secular nationalism clashed with [[Muslim Brotherhood]]'s Islamic political vision
- Conflict defined Egyptian politics from 1954 onward
- Brotherhood's radicalization (Sayyid Qutb's writings) partly response to Nasserist repression

## Legacy

### Positive Assessments
- **Anti-Imperialism**: Successfully expelled British, nationalized Suez Canal
- **Development**: Aswan Dam, industrialization, infrastructure modernization
- **Social Justice**: Land reform, free education, healthcare, reduced inequality
- **Arab Dignity**: Restored pride after colonial humiliation
- **Cultural Boom**: Egyptian cinema, music, literature flourished
- **Third World Leadership**: Non-Aligned Movement, developing world solidarity

### Negative Assessments
- **Authoritarianism**: Established pattern of military rule continuing to present
- **Human Rights Violations**: Systematic torture, mass imprisonment, executions
- **Military Dominance**: Armed forces became permanent ruling institution
- **Economic Mismanagement**: Socialism ultimately failed to develop Egypt
- **Foreign Policy Disasters**: Yemen quagmire, 1967 defeat
- **Chemical Weapons Use**: War crimes in Yemen
- **Jewish Expulsion**: Ethnic cleansing of ancient community

### Template for Authoritarianism
- Egypt under Nasser "established the template for military republics" across Arab world
- Similar regimes emerged in Syria, Iraq, Algeria, Libya, Sudan
- All characterized by:
  - Military-dominated government
  - Single-party systems
  - Repressive security services
  - Anti-imperialist rhetoric
  - Socialist economics

### Continuing Influence
- Nasserism remains significant political current in Egypt and Arab world
- Informs public dialogue on politics in Egypt
- Nasser's image evoked by both supporters and critics
- "Whether glorified or demonised... Nasser is an emotional and divisive subject"

### Historical Judgment
- "Egypt's political transformation from an aristocratic constitutional monarchy to an 'officers' republic' is Nasser's most enduring legacy today"
- Regime-form persists despite realignment of domestic and foreign policies
- Military rule interrupted only briefly (2012-2013) in 70+ years since 1952

## Key Figures
- **Jean-Bedel Bokassa** - President (1966-1976), Emperor Bokassa I (1976-1979); self-styled "His Imperial Majesty Bokassa I, Emperor of Central Africa and Apostle of Peace"; modeled himself after Napoleon Bonaparte
- **David Dacko** - First President of CAR (1960-1966), overthrown by Bokassa; cousin of Bokassa; restored to power by French in 1979
- **Barthelemy Boganda** - Founder of the Central African Republic; died in suspicious plane crash in 1959; uncle to both Dacko and Bokassa
- **Alexandre Banza** - Captain who helped Bokassa seize power in 1966; later attempted coup; executed April 12, 1969 after brutal torture
- **Jean Izamo** - Commander of gendarmerie under Dacko; tortured to death in January 1966 after the coup
- **Catherine Denguiade** - Empress Catherine; Bokassa's most prominent wife; crowned Empress at 1977 coronation
- **Elisabeth Domitien** - Prime Minister 1975-1976; first female prime minister in African history
- **Joseph Mokoa** - Security chief; carried out assassinations on Bokassa's orders
- **Valery Giscard d'Estaing** - President of France (1974-1981); close personal friend of Bokassa; implicated in diamonds scandal

## Classification
Personalist military dictatorship that evolved into a self-proclaimed monarchy, characterized by:
- Military coup origins with immediate consolidation of personal power
- Complete abolition of constitutional governance and rule by decree
- Self-declaration as President for Life (1972) and Emperor (1976)
- Cult of personality centered on Napoleon Bonaparte emulation
- Extreme kleptocracy with personal control of national resources
- Brutal repression including personal participation in torture and executions
- Secret police apparatus eliminating political opponents
- Heavy dependence on French military and economic support

Political scientists classify this as a personalist dictatorship rather than military regime because power was concentrated entirely in Bokassa personally. The transformation to monarchy was cosmetic; the regime remained an autocracy regardless of title.

## Pre-Conditions

### Colonial Legacy
French Equatorial Africa's Ubangi-Shari territory (later CAR) suffered particularly brutal colonial exploitation:
- **Concessionary Companies**: French companies like Forestiere used forced labor for rubber and timber extraction
- **Violence Against Natives**: Bokassa's own father, Mindogon, a village chief, was beaten to death by French company officials for refusing to continue providing forced laborers
- **Orphaned by Colonialism**: Bokassa's mother committed suicide shortly after his father's death, leaving him orphaned at age six
- **Educational System**: Catholic missionaries raised Bokassa, initially hoping he would become a priest

### Barthelemy Boganda and Independence Movement
- **Boganda's Rise**: First Central African priest (ordained 1938); elected to French National Assembly 1946
- **MESAN Party**: Founded Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN) in 1949
- **Autonomy Achieved**: Negotiated with De Gaulle for self-governance in 1958
- **Suspicious Death**: Died in plane crash March 29, 1959; investigators found traces of explosives but report was suppressed
- **Power Vacuum**: Boganda's death left the independence movement without its charismatic leader

### David Dacko's First Presidency (1960-1965)
After Boganda's death, his cousin David Dacko took control of MESAN and led the country to independence:
- **Independence**: CAR formally independent August 13, 1960
- **One-Party State**: Constitutional amendment in 1962 recognized MESAN as sole party
- **Corruption and Mismanagement**: Dacko's administration marked by political instability and ineffective governance
- **Economic Troubles**: Slow economic growth; border incursions by rebels from neighboring countries
- **China Relationship**: Dacko obtained financial aid from People's Republic of China, alarming France
- **Popular Discontent**: By 1965, Dacko had lost support of most Central Africans

### Bokassa's Military Career
Bokassa's path to power was shaped by his French military service:
- **French Army (1939-1962)**: Joined Free French forces; fought in WWII and First Indochina War
- **Decorated Veteran**: Received Legion of Honor, Croix de Guerre, and other French military decorations
- **Indochina Service**: Served in Saigon; fathered two daughters with Vietnamese woman during this period
- **Return to CAR (1962)**: Left French Army to join newly created Central African Armed Forces
- **Rapid Advancement**: Due to family connections (cousin of Dacko, nephew of Boganda) and French military experience, rose quickly
- **Commander-in-Chief**: By 1965, commanded the 500-soldier army; became first colonel December 1, 1964

---

## Rise to Power

### The Saint-Sylvestre Coup d'Etat (December 31, 1965 - January 1, 1966)

**Background**:
- Dacko learned of Bokassa's coup plans and attempted to counter by strengthening the gendarmerie under Jean Izamo
- Bokassa enlisted Captain Alexandre Banza to assist with the takeover
- French government concerned about Dacko's increasingly close ties with China

**The Coup**:
- **New Year's Eve 1965**: Bokassa and his men captured Izamo, locking him in a cellar at Camp de Roux
- **Occupation of Bangui**: Bokassa's forces occupied the capital and overpowered gendarmerie resistance
- **Dacko Arrested**: After midnight, Dacko returned to capital and was promptly arrested, forced to resign, and imprisoned at Camp Kassai
- **January 1, 1966**: Bokassa declared himself President of the Republic
- **Casualties**: Official reports stated eight people killed during takeover

**Immediate Aftermath**:
- Jean Izamo was tortured to death by end of January 1966
- Dacko's life was spared at request of French government, which Bokassa was eager to satisfy
- National Assembly dissolved; Constitution suspended
- Bokassa assumed all executive and legislative powers

**Justification**:
Bokassa claimed the coup was necessary to save the country from communism and immediately cut diplomatic relations with China. This anti-communist stance ensured continued French support.

### Consolidation of Power (1966-1972)

**Elimination of Rivals**:
- All political activity banned; MESAN revived in 1972 under Bokassa's control as sole legal party
- Political opponents imprisoned, tortured, or killed
- Alexandre Banza, the captain who helped execute the coup, became a threat

**The Banza Affair (1969)**:
- Banza served as minister of state and minister of finance
- 1967: Major disagreement with Bokassa over presidential extravagances
- April 1968: Bokassa removed Banza from finance ministry
- April 9, 1969: Banza's attempted coup betrayed by Jean-Claude Mandaba
- **Brutal Capture**: Soldiers broke Banza's arms before throwing him into car trunk
- **Personal Violence**: Bokassa beat Banza nearly to death at his Berengo residence
- **Military Tribunal**: April 12, 1969, Banza sentenced to death and executed by firing squad
- **Collective Punishment**: Banza's family, mistress, and associates arrested; some "disappeared"

**President for Life (1972)**:
- Bokassa declared himself President for Life
- Appointed Elisabeth Domitien as vice president of MESAN (1972), later as Prime Minister (1975) - first female PM in Africa

## Methods of Control

### Political Repression and Terror
Bokassa's regime was characterized by extreme brutality:
- **Personal Participation**: Bokassa himself frequently participated in beatings, torture, and executions
- **Arbitrary Killings**: Political opponents and aides suspected of disloyalty executed in gruesome ways
- **Collective Punishment**: Entire families wiped out to prevent revenge
- **Secret Police**: Network eliminated anyone who failed to support the regime
- **Disappearances**: Many political prisoners vanished without trace

### Torture Methods
The regime employed particularly brutal methods:
- **Ngaragba Prison**: Primary detention facility for political prisoners; site of torture and extrajudicial killings
- **Beatings**: Bokassa reportedly used an ivory-encrusted ebony cane to personally beat prisoners
- **Mutilation**: Thieves punished by having ears cut off
- **Feeding to Animals**: Political enemies allegedly fed to lions and crocodiles at Bokassa's palace
- **Public Executions**: Bokassa reportedly enjoyed attending public executions

### Personality Cult
Bokassa developed an elaborate cult of personality modeled on Napoleon Bonaparte:
- **Napoleonic Imagery**: Wore Napoleonic-style uniforms loaded with decorations
- **Grandiose Titles**: Accumulated titles culminating in Emperor
- **Mandatory Adulation**: Required displays of loyalty throughout society
- **Imperial Imagery**: Crown, regalia, and ceremonies modeled explicitly on Napoleon's 1804 coronation
- **Control of Narrative**: Media entirely controlled by state; no independent press

### Media and Information Control
- All media outlets under state control
- No independent journalism permitted
- Foreign journalists closely monitored
- Critical reporting resulted in imprisonment or worse

---

## Empire and Coronation

### Declaration of Empire (December 4, 1976)
At a MESAN congress on December 4, 1976, Bokassa instituted a new constitution:
- Central African Republic renamed Central African Empire
- Bokassa assumed title Emperor Bokassa I
- Created hereditary monarchy with elaborate court system
- Named his four-year-old son Jean-Bedel Bokassa Jr. as Crown Prince

### The Coronation (December 4, 1977)
The coronation of Bokassa I and Catherine was modeled explicitly on Napoleon's 1804 coronation:

**Date and Symbolism**:
- Scheduled for December 4, 1977 - the 173rd anniversary of Napoleon's coronation
- Held at a sports stadium in Bangui

**The Ceremony**:
- Bokassa removed his laurel wreath and placed the bejeweled crown on his own head, exactly as Napoleon had done
- Empress Catherine crowned alongside him
- Elaborate pageantry with hussars, carriages, and military displays

**Extravagant Costs**:
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| **Total Ceremony** | $20-30 million (estimates vary) |
| **Imperial Throne** | $2.5 million (gold-plated bronze, eagle-shaped, 2 tonnes, 13.6-ft wingspan, 800 gilded feathers) |
| **Crown** | $2 million (topped with 138-carat diamond) |
| **Total Regalia** | $5 million (crown, scepter, empress's diadem) |
| **Coronation Robe** | 32 pounds; 785,000 pearls; 1,220,000 crystal beads |
| **Imperial Wardrobe** | $145,000 (13 outfits by Guiselin/Pierre Cardin) |

The ceremony cost approximately one-third of the Central African Empire's entire annual budget and consumed all of France's foreign aid for that year.

**Lavish Details**:
- 240 tons of food and drink flown in including Chateau-Lafite Rothschild and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild wines
- Caviar tureen so large two chefs carried it in
- Seven-tier cake with doves that flew out over imperial table
- 60 new Mercedes-Benz automobiles ($5,000 airfreight each)
- Eight white horses from Belgium for imperial carriage
- Dozens of Norman gray horses for hussar escort

**Guest Attendance**:
- 2,500 foreign guests invited
- Only 600 actually attended
- Bokassa's comment: "They were jealous of me because I had an empire and they didn't"
- French Defense Minister sent battalion to secure ceremony; lent 17 aircraft; assigned Navy personnel to orchestra

---

## French Relations

### The Francafrique Connection
France maintained close ties with its former colony for strategic reasons:
- **Uranium Deposits**: CAR held significant uranium resources vital for France's nuclear program
- **Diamond Trade**: Valuable diamond mining operations
- **CFA Franc Zone**: Monetary union stability important to French economic interests
- **Regional Influence**: CAR strategically located in heart of Africa
- **Military Presence**: French troops stationed in region; defense agreements in place

### The Giscard-Bokassa Relationship
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing developed an unusually close personal relationship with Bokassa:
- **First Meeting**: At General de Gaulle's funeral in 1970
- **Private Visits**: Giscard visited CAR three times (December 1970, March 1971, April 1973) for private hunting trips before becoming president
- **Hunting Expeditions**: Bokassa's private forests in eastern CAR were Giscard's "chasse gardee" (private hunting ground)
- **Big Game**: Giscard reportedly shot elephants, giraffes, and rare white rhinos
- **Coronation Support**: France paid for much of the coronation in exchange for uranium access and break with Libya

### The Diamonds Affair
The scandal that contributed to Giscard's political downfall:

**The Gifts**:
- 1973: Giscard, then Finance Minister, received diamond plaque of 30 carats from Bokassa
- Multiple additional gifts allegedly given over following years
- Bokassa later claimed he gave diamonds "to the presidential couple on four occasions"
- Estimated value: approximately $1 million (today's value)

**Exposure**:
- October 10, 1979: Satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchaine published facsimile of 1973 diamond order
- September 1980: Le Canard Enchaine published telephone interview with exiled Bokassa confirming gifts
- May 8, 1981: Bokassa gave Washington Post interview two days before French election, confirming he gave 10-20 carat diamonds; claimed Giscard family "received more diamonds than anyone else"

**Giscard's Defense**:
- Claimed proceeds donated to Central African charities including Red Cross and maternity hospital
- Central African Red Cross stated they never received any donation from Giscard
- Diamonds allegedly sold for 114,977 francs

**Political Consequences**:
- Scandal contributed significantly to Giscard's 1981 electoral defeat to Francois Mitterrand
- "Although only 56 years old when he stepped down from the presidency, Giscard never again held high elective office"
- Theory emerged that Operation Barracuda was partly motivated by desire to seize Bokassa's papers before he could blackmail Giscard
- Affair "dramatically altered how France's Africa policy was perceived"

## Economic Policies and Kleptocracy

### Operation Bokassa
Bokassa initially claimed economic development as a priority:
- Launched "Operation Bokassa" national economic plan
- Created large nationalized farms and industries
- Plan stymied by corruption, mismanagement, and diversion of resources
- Implementation suffered from Bokassa's extravagances (especially coronation)

### Nationalization and State Control
- Nationalized all public entities and established personal monopolies
- Private sector drastically reduced
- People either worked for government (which struggled to pay salaries) or subsistence farming
- Mining operations had extremely poor working conditions with minimal returns to workers

### Personal Enrichment
- Supplied uranium to France in exchange for military support and financial aid
- Controlled diamond mining operations personally
- Gave diamonds worth millions to associates and foreign allies
- Foreign aid "disappeared into private pockets"
- Stark contrast between Bokassa's luxury lifestyle and popular poverty

### Economic Consequences
- By 1977 coronation, Bokassa's rule had effectively bankrupted the country
- GDP didn't recover until 9 years after Bokassa was ousted in 1979
- CAR remains one of poorest countries on Earth with GDP of only $2.52 billion (compared to Rwanda's $11 billion with fewer natural resources)
- Pattern of corruption and mismanagement established under Bokassa continued under subsequent governments

### School Uniform Decree (January 1979)
The final economic policy that precipitated Bokassa's downfall:
- Decreed all students must purchase and wear expensive uniforms
- Uniforms manufactured by company owned by one of Bokassa's wives
- Sold exclusively through Bokassa family retail stores
- Price unaffordable for most Central African families
- Triggered student protests that led to massacre

---

## Human Rights Abuses

### Systematic Torture and Execution
Throughout his 13-year rule, Bokassa's regime perpetrated:
- Torture of political prisoners as standard practice
- Extrajudicial executions of suspected opponents
- Disappearances of critics and their families
- Personal participation by Bokassa in violence

### Ngaragba Prison
The regime's primary detention facility for political prisoners:
- Overcrowded cells designed to cause suffering
- Systematic beatings by guards
- Torture chambers
- Site of mass killings including April 1979 schoolchildren massacre

### Allegations of Cannibalism
One of the most notorious allegations against Bokassa:
- **Photographic Evidence**: Paris Match published photographs allegedly showing butchered bodies in palace cold-storage rooms
- **Former President's Testimony**: David Dacko testified he saw photographs of bodies in freezers immediately after 1979 coup
- **Chef's Testimony**: Bokassa's former cook testified he prepared meals with human flesh stored in walk-in freezers and watched Bokassa eat them "with relish"
- **Foreign Dignitaries**: Witnesses claimed Bokassa enjoyed "fooling visiting foreign dignitaries by serving up his opponents as roast beef"
- **Trial Outcome**: Bokassa was acquitted of cannibalism at his 1987 trial due to insufficient evidence; consumption of human remains was classified as misdemeanor under CAR law

### U.S. Assessment
According to U.S. State Department: "His regime was characterized by numerous human rights atrocities." Bokassa earned the nickname "Butcher of Bangui."

## The 1979 Massacres

### January 1979 Food Riots
The crisis began with protests in Bangui:

- Mid-April: Plainclothes police infiltrated student meeting; upon discovery, students stripped them naked and pushed them into street
- This incident believed to trigger mass arrests

### The Ngaragba Prison Massacre (April 17-19, 1979)
Also known as the "Bangui Children's Massacre":

**Mass Arrests (April 17-18)**:
- Bokassa's soldiers rounded up students from protest districts
- Between 100-180 students arrested (estimates vary)

- Several survivors escaped by pretending to be dead

**Death Toll**:
- Independent judicial inquiry: "massacre of about 100 children"

- 27 survivors later identified themselves from 180 originally arrested

### International Response
- Foreign governments condemned Bokassa
- International organizations cut off aid
- August 1979: Panel of African investigators found Bokassa "complicit in the massacres"
- U.S. cut off aid
- International legitimacy destroyed
- French support eroded completely

---

## Overthrow: Operation Barracuda

### Background to French Intervention
Multiple factors converged to end French support:
- **January 1979 Massacres**: Food riots and brutal suppression shocked international community
- **April 1979 Children's Massacre**: Final straw that destroyed remaining legitimacy
- **Libyan Connection**: Bokassa sought closer ties with Muammar Gaddafi, alarming France
- **Early September 1979**: French intelligence chief Alexandre de Marenches informed Giscard that Bokassa was in Libya and 72 Libyan "military advisers" had arrived in Bangui
- **Diamonds Scandal**: Brewing scandal may have motivated France to seize Bokassa's papers

### Operation Barracuda (September 20-21, 1979)
The French covert operation to remove Bokassa:

**Preparation**:
- French forces positioned at African military bases in Libreville (Gabon) and N'Djamena (Chad)
- David Dacko recruited to return as president
- Operation planned while Bokassa was in Libya meeting Gaddafi

**Execution**:
- **September 19, 1979**: French commandos and 1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment flew Dacko into Bangui
- **September 20, 1979**: French paratroopers from 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2e REP) seized key locations including Bangui airport
- Approximately 900 French troops secured Bangui
- Bokassa loyalists neutralized
- Bokassa's attempt to return blocked by French forces

**Aftermath**:
- **12:30 PM, September 21, 1979**: Dacko proclaimed fall of Central African Empire
- Republic restored; country renamed Central African Republic
- Bokassa sought exile, eventually settling in France and Ivory Coast
- Called "France's last colonial expedition" by Jacques Foccart, veteran French diplomat

### Bokassa's Exile
- Initially sought refuge in France
- Later moved to Ivory Coast
- Lived in exile for seven years
- 1980: Condemned to death in absentia by CAR court
- Voluntarily returned to CAR in 1986

## Legacy and Historical Assessment

### Comparisons to Other Dictators
Bokassa is frequently compared to other notorious African dictators:
- **Idi Amin (Uganda)**: "The Western press... often compared his eccentric behavior and egotistical extravagance with that of another well-known eccentric African dictator"
- Both ruled in same era; both characterized by extreme brutality and bizarre behavior
- Both overthrown in 1979

### Historical Judgment
Scholars and observers have characterized Bokassa as:
- "Arguably the most infamous and bloodthirsty" of African despots
- "A monster. His reign was repulsively savage, even on a continent notorious for brutal dictators"
- One who "subjected his countrymen to a sanguinary reign of terror that lasted over a decade"

### The Napoleon Complex
Bokassa's obsession with Napoleon Bonaparte remains central to historical analysis:
- Explicitly modeled regime, ceremonies, and personal image on Napoleon
- Coronation was "practically a scene-by-scene remake of Napoleon's 1804 event"
- Some scholars see this as evidence of megalomania; others as calculated performance for international audience

### Media and Power
Scholars note Bokassa's media savvy:
- Anthropologist Mark Leopold (writing about Amin) noted some dictators "might have been the earliest politician to realise the importance of mass media"
- Bokassa's coronation was designed for international media coverage
- His theatricality ensured global attention

### Lasting Impact on CAR
- Established patterns of kleptocracy that continued under subsequent governments
- Economy devastated; GDP took 9 years to recover
- CAR remains one of world's poorest countries
- Political instability continued: multiple coups after Bokassa's fall
- "Jean-Bedel Bokassa has been dead for [decades], but... the late dictator remains the paradigm of excess and cruelty in this absurd and tragic country"

### Lessons
As one analysis concluded: "His horrific legacy is proof that absolute power can be a virus."

## Confidence Assessment
**Overall**: Medium-High

**Notes**:
- **Well-documented**: Coup events, coronation details, diamonds affair, schoolchildren massacre, trial and conviction, death
- **Multiple sources corroborate**: French relationship, Operation Barracuda, methods of repression, economic mismanagement
- **Death toll uncertainty**: Overall regime death toll poorly documented; massacre estimates range from 50-250; convicted of 20+ murders
- **Cannibalism question**: Acquitted at trial; testimony exists but evidence deemed insufficient; remains historically debated
- **Documentation gaps**: Many political killings and disappearances never systematically recorded
- **French archives**: Some French government documents regarding Operation Barracuda and Giscard relationship remain classified
- **Survivor testimony**: Limited; 27 survivors of 1979 massacre testified at trial
- **Areas of certainty**: Coronation extravagance, diamonds affair, Ngaragba massacre, French intervention all well-documented with contemporary sources

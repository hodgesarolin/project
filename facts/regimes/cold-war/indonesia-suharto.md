**The Night of September 30 - October 1, 1965**:

- By dawn of October 1, Suharto had taken command of army operations
- Within 24 hours, G30S troops in Jakarta surrendered or were defeated

- Cornell Paper (Anderson & McVey, 1966): Argued G30S was internal army affair, not PKI plot
- Some scholars note Suharto had advance knowledge and waited to act

### The Anti-Communist Purge (October 1965 - March 1966)

## Scholarly Debate

### Nature of the 1965-66 Killings

**Classification Debate**:
- **Genocide**: Some scholars argue killings meet genocide definition (targeting political group)
- **Politicide**: Term used by Barbara Harff for politically-motivated mass killing
- **Mass atrocity**: Broader characterization avoiding legal definitions

**Responsibility**:
- Role of army vs. civilian militias
- Extent of U.S. involvement and encouragement
- Religious organizations' participation (Muslim, some Christian groups)
- Local vs. centralized coordination

### Origins of G30S

**Competing Theories**:
- **Official version**: PKI coup attempt
- **Internal army conflict**: Cornell Paper thesis (Anderson & McVey)
- **Suharto involvement**: Some scholars suggest Suharto had advance knowledge
- Trial testimony of Colonel Latief accused Suharto of complicity

**Recent Scholarship**:
- Declassified documents continue to reveal new information
- Consensus that army response far exceeded any threat posed
- PKI leadership's actual involvement remains debated

### Development vs. Authoritarianism

**Pro-Development Arguments**:
- Economic growth averaged ~7% annually for decades

- Adult literacy rose from 62% (1971) to 84% (1990)
- Inflation controlled after initial crisis
- "Father of Development" title

**Critical Arguments**:
- Growth predicated partly on oil windfall (luck)
- Benefits concentrated among elite and Suharto family
- Extreme inequality
- Nepotism and corruption inhibited efficient development
- Comparison with South Korea shows better outcomes possible without authoritarianism
- Human cost: millions killed, imprisoned, or oppressed

### Memory and Historical Justice

**Historiographical Concerns**:
- Asvi Warman Adam and other historians warn of "whitewashing"
- Recent government projects to rehabilitate Suharto's legacy condemned
- Survivors and progressive historians working to preserve accurate history
- Debate over whether reform era (reformasi) has truly ended

**Authoritarian Nostalgia**:
- Some Indonesians express positive views of New Order era
- "Affordable prices" cited alongside "authoritarian" in polls
- Question of whether economic development justifies political repression

## Confidence Assessment
**Overall**: High

**Notes**:
- Death toll figures for 1965-66 killings remain contested but scholarly consensus exists for 500,000-1,000,000 range
- East Timor death tolls documented through official truth commission (CAVR)
- Methods of control well-documented through survivor testimony, declassified documents, and journalistic investigation
- U.S. role documented through declassified State Department and CIA files
- Some uncertainty remains around:
  - Exact death tolls (ranges provided)
  - True origins of G30S (scholarly debate ongoing)
  - Full extent of Suharto family wealth
  - Deaths in Aceh and Papua (less documented than East Timor)
- Areas of legitimate scholarly debate noted (G30S origins, development vs. authoritarianism trade-off)
- Ongoing concerns about historical revisionism in Indonesia may affect future historical consensus

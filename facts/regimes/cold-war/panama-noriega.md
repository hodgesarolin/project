---

## Pre-Conditions

### The Torrijos Era (1968-1981)
Omar Torrijos seized power in a military coup on October 11, 1968, just eleven days into President Arnulfo Arias's term. Torrijos established himself as Panama's "Maximum Leader of the Panamanian Revolution," ruling as military dictator while maintaining civilian facade governments.

**Torrijos's Governance**:
- Populist-nationalist ideology mixing left-wing rhetoric with anti-communism
- Land reform and expansion of social programs
- Cultivation of relationships with both the United States and Cuba
- Built National Guard into primary instrument of political power
- Promoted Manuel Noriega as head of military intelligence (G-2)

### The Panama Canal Treaties (1977)
Torrijos's signature achievement was the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, signed September 7, 1977:

**The Two Treaties**:
1. **Panama Canal Treaty**: Transferred canal control to Panama by December 31, 1999
2. **Treaty of Permanent Neutrality**: Declared canal neutral and open to all nations; allowed U.S. right to defend canal permanently

**Significance**:
- Ratified by U.S. Senate on March 16 and April 18, 1978 (68-32 votes)
- Represented end of U.S. colonial presence in Canal Zone
- Enhanced Torrijos's nationalist credentials domestically
- Completed on schedule December 31, 1999

### Torrijos's Death (1981)
On July 31, 1981, Omar Torrijos died in an airplane crash during a military inspection tour in Panama's jungle interior. His death created a power vacuum that Noriega would eventually fill.

### Noriega's Rise Through Intelligence
Noriega had been cultivating power for years:
- **1950s**: First recruited by U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (1959)
- **1960s**: Rose through National Guard ranks; became invaluable CIA asset after 1968 coup
- **1970s**: Headed military intelligence (G-2), becoming de facto intelligence broker for Panama
- **1976**: CIA Director George H.W. Bush paid Noriega $110,000 despite known drug trafficking involvement
- **1981-1983**: Maneuvered among military rivals following Torrijos's death

---

## Rise to Power

### Consolidation Within the Military (1981-1983)
After Torrijos's death, power initially passed to Colonel Florencio Florez, then to General Ruben Dario Paredes. Noriega, as head of intelligence, held crucial leverage over potential rivals through files documenting corruption and misconduct.

**The Deal with Paredes**:
General Paredes agreed to hand command to Noriega with the understanding that Noriega would support Paredes's presidential candidacy. On August 12, 1983, Paredes transferred command of the newly created Panama Defense Forces (PDF) to Noriega, newly promoted to general.

**The Betrayal**:
Noriega immediately reneged on the agreement, blocking Paredes's presidential ambitions. As commander of the PDF, Noriega became Panama's de facto ruler, controlling the country through puppet civilian presidents.

### Creation of the Panama Defense Forces (1983)
On September 29, 1983, Law 20 transformed the National Guard into the Panama Defense Forces, a comprehensive security apparatus:

**Structure**:
- Ground Forces (~4,000 combat troops)
- Panamanian Air Force
- National Navy
- Police Forces
- Customs and immigration control
- Transportation network oversight
- Total strength: approximately 12,800-17,000 by 1989

**Key Units**:
- 7th Infantry Company "Macho de Monte" (guerrilla warfare)
- 1st Public Order Company "Doberman" (riot police)
- UESAT (Unidades Especiales de Servicio Anti Terror) — Israeli-trained counter-terrorism unit

**Intelligence Apparatus**:
Noriega expanded the G-2 Military Intelligence Section into a feared secret police, even within PDF ranks. It conducted surveillance, intimidation, and elimination of opponents.

### The 1984 Rigged Election
Panama's first elections in 16 years were held in May 1984:

**Noriega's Candidate**:
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, a U.S.-educated economist with connections to Secretary of State George Shultz (his former professor at University of Chicago) and former World Bank vice president.

**The Fraud**:
- Opposition candidate Arnulfo Arias appeared headed to landslide victory
- Noriega ordered vote counting halted
- After 10 days of manipulation, Barletta declared winner by 1,713 votes
- CIA concluded Arias actually won by 25,000-30,000 votes
- One Electoral Tribunal member abstained from certifying results

**U.S. Complicity**:
Despite conclusive intelligence of fraud, Secretary of State Shultz headed the U.S. delegation to Barletta's inauguration in October 1984.

**Later Admission**:
Colonel Roberto Diaz Herrera later confessed: "I can give all the details of the fraud because it took place in my own home."

---

## Methods of Control

### Rule Through Puppet Presidents
Noriega never officially served as president, preferring to rule from behind the scenes through the PDF while civilian figureheads provided democratic facade:

1. **Nicolas Ardito Barletta** (1984-1985): Forced to resign after calling for Spadafora murder investigation
2. **Eric Arturo Delvalle** (1985-1988): Removed after attempting to dismiss Noriega
3. **Manuel Solis Palma** (1988-1989): Acting president during crisis period
4. **Francisco Rodriguez** (1989): Installed after annulled elections

### The Panama Defense Forces
The PDF controlled every aspect of Panamanian life:
- **Political control**: Military approval required for all major decisions
- **Economic control**: Customs, ports, transportation under PDF authority
- **Media control**: Newspapers bought or shut down; journalists harassed, intimidated, exiled
- **Judicial control**: Courts subordinated to military interests

### Dignity Battalions (Batallones de la Dignidad)
Created in April 1988 as paramilitary militia to supplement PDF:

**Organization**:
- 11 organized battalions, 7 planned for rural areas
- 25-250 volunteers per battalion
- Total membership: 3,000-10,000
- Led by Benjamin Colamarco
- Administered through PDF "Dignity Brigade Staff"

**Purpose**:
- Officially: Defend against U.S. invasion, patriotic youth organization
- Actually: Armed thugs for attacking political opponents
- Could be counted on to kill civilians unlike regular military

**Membership**:
- Regime claimed lower middle-class and rural volunteers
- Critics alleged inclusion of criminals released from prison

**Key Action**:
May 1989 — attacked opposition candidates after elections, beating Guillermo Endara and others while international media filmed

### Drug Trafficking Connections
Noriega transformed Panama into a narco-kleptocracy:

**Colombian Cartel Relations**:
- $100,000-$200,000 per cocaine planeload transiting Panama
- Monthly commission up to $4 million from Medellin cartel
- Protection for cartel money laundering through Panamanian banks
- Estimated personal fortune: $200-800 million by 1989

**Protection for Drug Operations**:
- DEA investigations blocked due to CIA relationship
- Panamanian banking secrecy facilitated money laundering
- PDF provided security for drug shipments

### Intelligence Double-Dealing
Noriega simultaneously served multiple masters:

**U.S. Services**:
- Intelligence on Latin American leftist movements
- Listening posts in Panama for U.S. surveillance
- Support for Contra operations against Nicaragua
- Conduit for weapons and funds to U.S.-backed forces

**Services to Others**:
- Shared classified U.S. documents with Cuba's Fidel Castro
- Provided intelligence to Sandinista Nicaragua
- Maintained relationships with communist regimes

**CIA Payments**:
- On CIA payroll from 1960s to 1986
- $200,000 per year by mid-1980s
- Government claimed $322,000 total; Noriega claimed $10 million

## Key Events & Atrocities

### Hugo Spadafora Murder (September 1985)
Hugo Spadafora was a physician, guerrilla fighter (in Guinea-Bissau and Nicaragua), and political activist who had clashed with Noriega since the Torrijos era.

**Background**:
In September 1985, Spadafora publicly accused Noriega of drug trafficking connections and announced his intention to expose the general.

**The Murder**:
- September 13, 1985: Spadafora detained by PDF at Concepcion, near Costa Rican border
- His decapitated, tortured body found in a U.S. mail bag in a ravine in Costa Rica
- Autopsy revealed: torture, sodomy, slow decapitation (stomach full of blood he had swallowed)
- Head never recovered

**Political Fallout**:
- President Barletta called for investigation
- Noriega forced Barletta to resign (September 27, 1985)
- Murder shocked Panama and international community
- Contributed to U.S.-Noriega relationship deterioration

**Justice**:
October 1993: Noriega convicted in absentia in Panama, sentenced to 20 years for ordering the murder.

### Diaz Herrera Revelations (June 1987)
Colonel Roberto Diaz Herrera, Noriega's former second-in-command, publicly confessed regime crimes:
- Confirmed 1984 election fraud ("it took place in my own home")
- Implicated Noriega in Spadafora murder

**Aftermath**:
- Mass protests erupted against Noriega
- Regime declared state of emergency
- Diaz Herrera arrested; eventually went into exile

### The 1989 Annulled Election
May 7, 1989 elections pitted opposition coalition ADOC (Guillermo Endara) against pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque:

**Results**:

## Scholarly Debate

### CIA Complicity and the "Our Bastard" Doctrine
**Key Questions**:
- Did U.S. intelligence agencies knowingly protect a drug trafficker?
- How did anti-communist priorities override anti-drug policy?
- What responsibility does the U.S. bear for Noriega's crimes?

**Documented Facts**:
- CIA knew of Noriega's drug involvement as early as 1971
- Payments continued despite this knowledge
- CIA Director William Casey reportedly said of Noriega: "He's a bastard, but he's our bastard"
- DEA investigations blocked due to CIA relationship

**Scholarly View**:
Historian Michael Grow: "Manuel Noriega was a very useful Cold War ally of the United States from the earliest phases of his career. He had a very good working relationship with U.S. intelligence and the U.S. military, and was delivering all kinds of valuable intelligence to the United States."

The case exemplifies Cold War-era pattern of U.S. tolerance for authoritarian allies regardless of human rights violations or criminal activity, as long as they served anti-communist objectives.

### Iran-Contra Connections
**1985 Oliver North Meeting**:
- North met Noriega in Panama
- Noriega agreed to train Contra soldiers
- In exchange, U.S. ignored drug smuggling through weapons networks

**Kerry Committee Findings (1989)**:
Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Communications found "substantial evidence of drug smuggling through the war zone" by Contras and supporters, with U.S. officials failing "to address the drug issue for fear of jeopardizing the war efforts against Nicaragua."

### Drug War Contradictions
**The Paradox**:
- Noriega served on front lines of U.S. "war on drugs" in 1970s-80s
- Simultaneously operated major drug trafficking enterprise
- U.S. agencies competed: DEA sought prosecution while CIA provided protection
- Invasion justified partly by drug trafficking, yet trafficking increased afterward

**Scholarly Analysis**:
Academic work has documented how Reagan administration tolerated cocaine trafficking by Contra sympathizers as long as revenue supported the Contra war effort. This "guns-for-drugs" arrangement implicated figures throughout the U.S. national security apparatus.

### Operation Just Cause Legal Debates
**Contested Issues**:
- Legality under international law
- Proportionality of civilian casualties
- Precedent for future interventions (Iraq, Panama as model)
- Self-defense claims vs. regime change

**OAS/UN Response**:
Both organizations condemned invasion as violation of international law, raising questions about U.S. exceptionalism in hemispheric affairs.

### Casualty Disputes
**Why Numbers Differ**:
- U.S. military controlled initial documentation
- Mass graves created hastily
- Records remain classified
- Panamanian government figures derived from U.S. sources
- Independent investigations limited

**Historical Significance**:
The casualty debate reflects broader questions about accountability for civilian deaths in U.S. military operations and the adequacy of official investigations.

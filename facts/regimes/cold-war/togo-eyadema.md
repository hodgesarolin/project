## Pre-Conditions

### German and French Colonial Rule
Togo's colonial history shaped its post-independence trajectory:
- Originally German Togoland (1884-1914), a German protectorate
- During World War I, British and French forces seized the territory
- The League of Nations mandated French administration of eastern Togo (present-day Togo) and British administration of western Togo (later merged with Gold Coast/Ghana)
- France administered the territory from 1922 until independence
- Colonial policies created regional disparities between the more developed south and the less developed north

### Ethnic Divisions
Togo's ethnic landscape created enduring political tensions:
- **Southern ethnic groups**: Ewe (largest group), Mina, and others dominated commerce, education, and civil service during colonial period
- **Northern ethnic groups**: Kabye, Kotokoli, and others were recruited into the French colonial military
- Many southerners viewed northerners with prejudice, regarding inhabitants of the north as less civilized
- The French military created a pool of trained northern soldiers who would later shape Togolese politics

### Independence and the First Republic (1960-1963)
Sylvanus Olympio led Togo to independence:
- Olympio became prime minister in 1958 and president when Togo gained full independence on April 27, 1960
- An Ewe from the south, educated at the London School of Economics, Olympio worked for Unilever
- Olympio pursued independent policies, distancing Togo from France
- He considered leaving the CFA franc zone and creating a Togolese currency backed by the Deutsche Mark
- French officials, particularly Jacques Foccart (de Gaulle's Africa advisor), viewed Olympio as anti-French

### The Assassination of Sylvanus Olympio (January 13, 1963)
The assassination that brought Eyadema to prominence:
- Olympio refused to integrate approximately 626 Togolese veterans of the French colonial army into Togo's small military
- On September 24, 1962, Olympio rejected a personal plea by Sergeant Etienne Eyadema to join the Togolese military
- Shortly after midnight on January 13, 1963, soldiers broke into Olympio's residence
- Olympio fled toward the U.S. Embassy but was shot before reaching the door
- His body was discovered three feet from the embassy entrance by U.S. Ambassador Leon Poullada
- Eyadema claimed to have personally fired the fatal shot (he later denied this)
- This was the first military coup in post-independence French Africa

### The Grunitzky Interregnum (1963-1967)
Following the 1963 coup:
- Nicolas Grunitzky, a more France-friendly politician, was installed as president
- France quickly recognized the new government and signed a military assistance pact
- Grunitzky's government proved unstable, marked by internal divisions
- Political tensions and factionalism continued between ethnic and regional groups

---

## Rise to Power

### The 1967 Coup
Eyadema seized power on January 13, 1967, exactly four years after Olympio's assassination:
- A bloodless coup overthrew Grunitzky's civilian government
- Eyadema, then a lieutenant colonel and army chief of staff, dissolved the government
- He installed himself as president on April 14, 1967
- In addition to the presidency, he awarded himself the post of Defense Minister
- All political parties were banned
- Eyadema justified the coup as necessary to end political instability

### Consolidation of Power
Eyadema rapidly established authoritarian control:
- Suspended the constitution and ruled by decree
- Created a military government dominated by northern officers
- Established the Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) in 1969 as the sole legal political party
- A 1972 referendum, in which Eyadema ran unopposed, confirmed him as president
- The 1979 constitution formally designated the RPT as the "supreme guide" of the nation

---

## Methods of Control

### The Rally of the Togolese People (RPT)
The RPT served as the instrument of one-party rule:

**Structure and Role**:
- Founded on November 29, 1969, with Eyadema as party president
- Only legally permitted political party from 1969 to 1991
- The president of the RPT was automatically elected president of the republic
- Platform based on "national unity" and "cultural authenticity"
- All citizens effectively subject to party control

**Constitutional Entrenchment**:
- The December 30, 1979 referendum designated the RPT as the "supreme guide" of the nation
- RPT candidates won all 67 seats in the National Assembly without opposition
- 1985 legislative elections: RPT secured all 77 Assembly seats
- Multi-party politics nominally restored in 1991, but RPT (and later UNIR) maintained dominance

### Personality Cult
Eyadema cultivated one of Africa's most extensive personality cults:

**Symbolic Elements**:
- Portraits adorned most stores and public buildings
- Bronze statue erected in Lome (torn down during 1991 protests, later rebuilt)
- Wristwatches featured his portrait that appeared and disappeared every fifteen seconds
- A comic book depicted him as a superhero with powers of invulnerability and super strength
- Entourage of 1,000 dancing women who sang and danced in his praise

**The Sarakawa "Miracle" (January 24, 1974)**:
- A presidential C-47 aircraft crashed near Sarakawa in northern Togo
- The French pilot and three political/military aides died
- Eyadema survived and attributed his survival to mystical powers
- He claimed the crash was a French imperialist plot to stop his nationalization of phosphate mines
- A massive monument was built at the crash site, housing the plane's wreckage
- The monument featured a statue donated by North Korea
- Eyadema changed his first name from Etienne to Gnassingbe to commemorate the date
- "The Feast of Victory Over Forces of Evil" was annually commemorated

**Quasi-Religious Status**:
- Eyadema was presented as possessing supernatural powers
- His survival of multiple assassination attempts reinforced the mystical narrative
- According to a 2018 academic study, his rule "rested on repression, patronage, and a bizarre leadership cult"

### Ethnic Favoritism
The regime was built on Kabye ethnic dominance:

**Military Control**:
- Approximately 75% of army officers and soldiers were from Eyadema's Kabye ethnic group
- The military served as both instrument of rule and guarantee of regime survival
- Northern ethnic kinsmen formed elite security units
- The army's loyalty was maintained through patronage and ethnic solidarity

**Government and Civil Service**:
- Under Olympio and Grunitzky, Ewes comprised ~70% of cabinet positions and Kabye ~20%
- Under Eyadema, this ratio reversed: only ~25% Ewe in cabinet
- Kabye occupied more than twice their proportional share of government positions
- Northern ethnic groups dominated the public sector, especially security forces
- Southern Ewe maintained prominence in private commerce and professions

**Resulting Tensions**:
- North-south ethnic tensions became a defining feature of Togolese politics
- The 2008 UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination noted persistent ethnic imbalances
- Ethnic discrimination remained salient, with 20-40 ethnic groups affected by Kabye dominance

### Repression and Political Violence
The regime employed systematic violence against opponents:

**Secret Police and Military**:
- Security forces conducted arbitrary arrests, torture, and extrajudicial killings
- Political dissidents were summarily executed or "disappeared"
- Tens of thousands killed or disappeared over 38 years according to various estimates
- Culture of complete impunity: no security officer ever prosecuted for extrajudicial killing

**Forced Exile**:
- Many hundreds of thousands fled abroad, creating large exile communities
- Opposition leaders based primarily in Ghana, France, and elsewhere
- Return often meant arrest, torture, or death

### Economic Control and Patronage
Eyadema maintained power through economic management:

**Phosphate Wealth**:
- Togo possessed significant phosphate deposits, a key export commodity
- Revenues financed patronage networks and ethnic balancing
- 1974 nationalization of phosphate mining company (though actual control remained limited)
- Economic downturn in 1980s-90s from falling phosphate prices weakened patronage capacity

**Patronage System**:
- Meticulous ethnic balancing of cabinet positions
- Open-door economic policy attracted support from traders
- State resources distributed to maintain loyalty networks
- Civil service jobs used as patronage rewards

---

## The 1991 Democratization Crisis

### Background
The end of the Cold War and democratization wave swept Africa:
- October 5, 1990: Student trials sparked riots in Lome
- Months of anti-government demonstrations followed
- International pressure mounted for political reform
- Domestic pro-democracy movement gained strength

### The National Conference (July-August 1991)
Following mass protests, Eyadema agreed to reforms:

**Establishment**:
- April 1991: Government began negotiations with opposition groups
- General amnesty permitted exiled opponents to return
- June 12, 1991: Agreement to hold a "national forum"
- July 8, 1991: National Conference opened in Lome

**Actions of the Conference**:
- Four days after convening, the conference declared itself sovereign
- Umbrella opposition group (Collective of Democratic Opposition/COD) organized general strike

- Conference attempted to strip Eyadema of most powers
- Joseph Kokou Koffigoh, human rights lawyer and bar association president, appointed interim Prime Minister
- RPT was banned by the High Council of the Republic (transitional parliament)

### Eyadema's Counter-Attack
The democratic transition was violently reversed:

**Military Actions**:
- October 1991: Security forces attacked the Prime Minister's residence
- December 1991: Soldiers loyal to Eyadema stormed transitional government offices
- Soldiers demanded lifting of RPT ban
- Prime Minister Koffigoh was captured and held prisoner

**Outcome**:
- Koffigoh released after agreeing to soldiers' demands
- New government formed giving RPT member secondary responsibility for military affairs
- Period from 1991-1993 witnessed worst violence in Togo's history
- Security forces killed hundreds of pro-democracy activists and protesters
- Mass exodus of civilians, particularly from southern opposition strongholds
- Some observers characterized actions as ethnic cleansing

### Aftermath: Flawed Multi-Party Elections
Eyadema manipulated the new multi-party system:

**1993 Presidential Election**:
- Opposition boycotted the election
- Eyadema declared victor in absence of meaningful competition

**1998 Presidential Election**:
- June 21, 1998: Presidential election held
- June 24, 1998: Interior Minister proclaimed Eyadema winner with 52%
- Opposition denounced results as fraudulent
- International observers noted irregularities

---

## The 1998 Election Crisis and Lagoon Murders

### The Election
The 1998 presidential election was marked by severe irregularities:
- Electoral commission chairman forced to flee to Benin before counting completed
- Official results gave Eyadema 52%, just enough to avoid runoff
- Opposition and international observers rejected results as fraudulent

### Allegations of Mass Killings
Reports emerged of systematic killings around the election:

**Amnesty International Report (May 1999)**:
- Documented that hundreds of bodies—presumably opposition members—were thrown into the sea
- Reported around the time of the June 1998 presidential election
- Hundreds of people extrajudicially executed
- Dozens of civilians, including opposition activists, arrested and tortured

**Government Response**:
- The government vigorously disputed the report's findings
- Threatened to sue Amnesty International
- Argued that no foreign journalists or observers reported bodies washing ashore
- However, local newspaper L'Aurore (August 13, 1998) mentioned bodies washing up on Togolese and Beninese shores

**UN/OAU Investigation**:
- November 1998: Joint UN/OAU commission visited Togo and Benin
- Investigated allegations of hundreds of extrajudicial killings during election period
- Findings confirmed pattern of serious human rights violations

### The Lagoon of Be Massacre (1991)
An earlier documented atrocity:
- April 10, 1991: Government established curfew, announced one hour after it began
- April 11, 1991: Inhabitants of Lome found 28 bodies in the Lagoon of Be
- National Human Rights Commission determined Togolese Armed Forces carried out the massacre
- This massacre remains unpunished

---

## Key Events & Atrocities

### The January 1994 Executions
Following an alleged attack on Lome:
- At least 48 prisoners extrajudicially executed by Togolese Armed Forces

- Arbitrary arrests followed by torture and ill-treatment
- Deaths in detention from torture
- Political prisoners routinely subjected to abuse
- Not a single Togolese policeman, soldier, or gendarme ever charged with extrajudicial killing

### Death Toll Estimates
Precise figures are difficult to establish:

**During Eyadema's Rule (1967-2005)**:
- Tens of thousands summarily executed or "disappeared" according to scholarly estimates

## Scholarly Debate

### Ethnic Politics Interpretation
**Central Question**: To what extent was Eyadema's regime defined by ethnic favoritism?

**Arguments Supporting Ethnic Interpretation**:
- Clear statistical over-representation of Kabye in military and government
- Security forces drawn predominantly from Eyadema's ethnic kinsmen
- Opposition concentrated among southern Ewe population
- Violence during democratic transition targeted southern areas

**Complicating Factors**:
- Eyadema attempted "meticulous ethnic balancing" of cabinet
- Patronage networks extended beyond Kabye core
- Some southern elites co-opted into regime
- Ethnic categories themselves are contested constructs

### Cold War Support and French Complicity

**The Francafrique Question**:
- France maintained close military and economic ties throughout Eyadema's rule
- 1963 defense agreement authorized French intervention
- French military intervention in 1986 saved Eyadema from coup
- France provided consistent diplomatic support despite human rights record

**Scholarly Assessments**:
- Researcher Comi Toulabor (Centre d'etudes d'Afrique noire): Eyadema survived through "systematic electoral fraud, the faithful allegiance of an army packed with supporters and members of his Kabye ethnic group, solid foreign support (especially from France), and adroit management of access to Togo's meagre economic resources"
- French complicity in 1963 Olympio assassination remains debated
- France's Foccart acknowledged Olympio was "not one of our friends"

### Personalist vs. Institutional Rule

**Personalist Elements**:
- Extreme personality cult with mystical elements
- Power concentrated in Eyadema personally
- Family members in key positions
- Successful father-to-son succession

**Institutional Elements**:
- RPT provided organizational structure
- Military institutionalized as pillar of regime
- Patronage networks created systematic distribution
- Some argue regime showed more institutional resilience than purely personalist dictatorships

### Comparison to Other African Dictators

Eyadema frequently compared to:
- **Mobutu Sese Seko (Zaire)**: Fellow French-aligned Cold War dictator; personality cult; ethnic patronage; U.S./Western support
- **Hastings Kamuzu Banda (Malawi)**: Long-serving personalist dictator; survived into post-Cold War era
- **Omar Bongo (Gabon)**: French-backed dictator; successful dynastic succession
- **Sekou Toure (Guinea)**: Single-party rule; personality cult; different ideological orientation

### Key Scholarly Works
- Comi M. Toulabor, writings on Togolese politics and the Eyadema regime
- Research on national conferences in Benin and Togo (Cambridge University Press)
- Studies on ethnic politics and democratization in West Africa
- Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documentation

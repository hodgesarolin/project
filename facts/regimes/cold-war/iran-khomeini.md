## Death and Legacy

### Khomeini's Death (June 3, 1989)
- Died after decade as Supreme Leader
- Body kept frozen three days for mourners
- Massive public mourning; millions attended funeral
- Designated successor Montazeri had been dismissed in March 1989 over criticism of 1988 massacres

### Succession to [[iran-khamenei|Khamenei]]
- Constitutional crisis: Khamenei was not a marja' (Grand Ayatollah) as constitution required
- Rafsanjani engineered behind-the-scenes selection
- Assembly of Experts convened June 4, 1989
- Constitution amended to remove marja' requirement
- Khamenei reconfirmed August 6, 1989 (60 of 64 votes)
- Has served as Supreme Leader since 1989 (35+ years)

### Lasting Institutional Impact
- IRGC: "most powerful and feared organization in Iran"; controls economy, foreign operations
- Velayat-e faqih enshrined in constitution; Supreme Leader position paramount
- Revolutionary courts remain active
- "Politics in the legal sphere of the Islamic Republic has been 'largely defined by attempts to claim Khomeini's legacy'"
- "Staying faithful to his ideology has been the litmus test for all political activity"
- Both reformists and hardliners claim Khomeini's mantle for different agendas

Sources: [Wikipedia - Khomeinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khomeinism), [Britannica - Ruhollah Khomeini](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ruhollah-Khomeini)

### Regional Legacy
- Hezbollah remains Iranian proxy; major force in Lebanon
- Model for other Shia militant movements
- Iran-Saudi rivalry for regional influence continues
- "Iranian revolution remains unfinished and its basic principles continue to be deeply contested"
- No evolution toward liberal democracy as some predicted
- Theocratic jurist rule has not spread to other countries as Khomeini hoped

## Scholarly Debates

### The Nature of Theocratic Governance
- Debate: Is Iran purely theocratic or hybrid regime?
- Some scholars categorize as "hybrid regime" - neither fully democratic nor fully authoritarian
- "Theocratic democracy" concept debated: can Islam and democracy be compatible under clerical rule?
- Constitution contains both theocratic provisions and social-democratic/liberal elements
- "Competing notions of authority" exploited by different factions

Sources: [ETH Zurich - Iran Theocratic Regime Study](https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/26514/PN05.07.pdf), [Academia - Theocratic Democracy Iran](https://www.academia.edu/31252028/What_is_Theocratic_Democracy_a_Case_Study_of_Iranian_Political_System)

### Velayat-e Faqih Theory
- Innovation or tradition? Khomeini's ideas "broke sharply from Shi'i traditions" (Abrahamian)
- 11 centuries of debate, but no prior claim clergy should "control the state"
- Only one Grand Ayatollah besides Khomeini approved concept
- Most senior clerics rejected it
- Debate: Does velayat-e faqih represent genuine Shia theology or political innovation?

Sources: [Wikipedia - Guardianship of Islamic Jurist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardianship_of_the_Islamic_Jurist)

### Revolutionary Islam and Political Theory
- Khomeini demonstrated "revolutionary potential of religious commitments"
- Challenged view that "religion tends to inhibit large-scale social change"
- Generated "force and depth of feeling" for "structural transformation of society"
- Debate: Was revolution primarily religious or socioeconomic in motivation?
- Mixed coalition (secularists, leftists, liberals) eventually dominated by Islamists

Sources: [Retrospect Journal - Role of Khomeini](https://retrospectjournal.com/2025/03/30/the-role-of-khomeini-in-the-1979-iranian-revolution/)

### Militarization Thesis
- Debate since 2005: Is Iran evolving from theocracy to military dictatorship?
- IRGC's expanding political and economic role
- Some see "silent revolution" toward militarized security state
- Others see elections producing "ideological military dictatorship"
- Alternative view: IRGC serves clerical establishment rather than dominating it

## Confidence Assessment

| Category | Confidence | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Basic dates and facts | HIGH | Well-documented in multiple sources |
| Velayat-e faqih doctrine | HIGH | Primary texts and scholarly analysis available |
| IRGC formation/growth | HIGH | Multiple corroborating sources |
| 1988 massacre death toll | MEDIUM | Estimates range from 5,000 to 30,000 |
| 1981-82 massacre toll | MEDIUM | Range of 3,500-11,000 documented |
| Baha'i persecution | HIGH | UN, Amnesty, HRW documentation |
| Kurdish repression toll | MEDIUM | ~10,000 killed commonly cited |
| Iran-Iraq War casualties | MEDIUM | Range of 500,000-1,000,000+ |
| Hezbollah creation | HIGH | Well-documented; acknowledged by parties |
| Constitutional structure | HIGH | Primary document available |
| Rushdie fatwa | HIGH | Contemporaneously documented |

### Key Uncertainties
- **1988 massacre death toll**: UN cited 30,000; most estimates 4,500-5,000; exact figure unknown
- **Total political executions 1979-1989**: Estimates range 12,500-60,000+
- **Chemical weapons casualties**: Iranian sources cite 100,000+; independent estimates vary
- **Exact extent of IRGC's economic control**: Difficult to verify

### Sources Requiring Caution
- Iranian government sources (may minimize atrocities)
- MEK/NCRI sources (may exaggerate for political purposes)
- Contemporary Western intelligence assessments (Cold War framing)
- Opposition exile accounts (potential bias)

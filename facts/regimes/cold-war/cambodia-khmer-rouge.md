| Some scholars | 275,000-310,000 total war deaths |

**Effects on Khmer Rouge recruitment**:
- Destroyed villages, farmland, livestock
- Created massive refugee crisis (2 million displaced)
- Fueled anti-American and anti-government sentiment
- Ben Kiernan (Yale): Khmer Rouge "used the bombing's devastation and massacre of civilians as recruitment propaganda"

### The 1970 Coup
- March 18, 1970: Sihanouk deposed by **General Lon Nol** while abroad
- US supported new Lon Nol government (Khmer Republic)

## Rise to Power

### Origins of the Communist Movement

**The Paris Circle (1950s)**:
- Key leaders studied in France on government scholarships
- Pol Pot (Saloth Sar) arrived 1949, studied radio electronics
- Ieng Sary arrived 1950
- Khieu Samphan earned doctorate in economics from University of Paris
- Joined French Communist Party
- 1951: Pol Pot and Ieng Sary traveled to East Berlin youth festival — turning point in their ideology

**Formation of Cambodian Communist Party**:
- 1960: Workers' Party of Kampuchea (WPK) founded secretly in Phnom Penh
- 1963: Pol Pot became party secretary after predecessor's disappearance
- Party later renamed Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK)
- Known publicly only as "Angkar" (the Organization)

### Alliance with Sihanouk (1970)
- Sihanouk's radio endorsement after coup dramatically boosted recruitment
- Royal Government of National Union of Kampuchea (GRUNK) formed as government-in-exile
- Many recruits were "apolitical peasants who fought in support of the king, not for communism"

### Fall of Phnom Penh (April 17, 1975)
- April 1, 1975: President Lon Nol fled to Hawaii
- April 12: Last Americans evacuated embassy (Operation Eagle Pull)
- April 17: Khmer Rouge forces entered Phnom Penh
- Victory came just 12 days before fall of Saigon
- Democratic Kampuchea declared in 1976

---

## Methods of Control

### Year Zero — Evacuation of Cities
- Declared April 17, 1975 as "Year Zero" — complete reset of society
- **2.5 million residents of Phnom Penh** ordered to evacuate immediately
- Claimed Americans were about to bomb the city
- No exceptions: hospital patients dragged from beds, women gave birth on roads
- Death marches in scorching April heat killed thousands
- All major cities emptied
- Goal: Transform Cambodia into agrarian utopia

### Angkar (The Organization)
- CPK's identity kept secret until 1977
- Referred to only as "Angkar" or "Angkar Loeu" (Higher Organization)
- Presented as omniscient, omnipresent authority
- Daily operations from Office 870 in Phnom Penh
- Pol Pot revealed CPK's existence only in March 1977 speech

### Social Control and Surveillance
- **Krom system**: Lowest unit of 10-15 families supervised by three-person committee
- Grassroots leaders reported "social origin" of each family
- Mutual denunciation encouraged and required
- "New people" (urban evacuees) vs. "old people" (peasants) distinction
- New people: lowest food rations, hardest labor, most vulnerable to execution

### Destruction of Traditional Society
- **Money abolished** — all currency worthless
- **Private property eliminated** — everything belonged to Angkar
- **Religion banned** — Buddhist monks defrocked or killed, temples destroyed, mosques demolished
- **Schools closed** — education seen as bourgeois
- **Books and libraries destroyed**
- **Family structure attacked** — communal eating, children separated from parents

### Ideological Control
- "Memory sickness" (nostalgia for pre-revolutionary times) was punishable
- People told to "forge" new revolutionary character
- Self-criticism sessions ("learning and reciting")
- Citizens described as "instruments" of Angkar
- Wearing glasses could mark someone as intellectual (target for execution)

### Collective Labor System
- Population forced into agricultural collectives
- 12-16 hour workdays in rice paddies
- Minimal food rations (often just watery rice gruel)
- No modern farming equipment or techniques
- Unrealistic production quotas
- Failure to meet quotas could mean death

- Imams executed
- **Before 1975**: ~250,000 Cham
- **By 1979**: More than half killed (estimates: 90,000-500,000)

**Chinese**:
- **1975**: 425,000 ethnic Chinese in Cambodia
- **1979**: 200,000 remaining
- ~50% mortality rate — higher than general urban population (33%)

### Death Toll Estimates

**Scholarly Estimates**:
| Source | Estimate | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Patrick Heuveline (UCLA) | 1.17-3.42 million (1970-79) | Central estimate: 2.52 million excess deaths |
| Heuveline (95% confidence) | 1.2-2.8 million | For KR period specifically |
| Wikipedia/Scholarly consensus | 1.5-2 million | Most commonly cited range |
| Yale Genocide Studies | 1.7-2.2 million | 21-25% of population |
| PRK government (1979) | 3.3 million | Generally considered inflated |

**Breakdown by cause** (Heuveline):
- Violent deaths: ~1.1 million (1975-1979)
- War casualties (1970-75): 150,000-300,000
- Starvation, disease, overwork: remainder

**As percentage of population**: ~25% of 7.8 million Cambodians died

## Scholarly Debate

### Genocide vs. Politicide

**The Legal Definition Problem**:
- UN Genocide Convention protects only religious, ethnic, racial, and national groups
- Most KR victims targeted for political ideology or class status
- ECCC recognized genocide **only** for Vietnamese and Cham minorities
- Broader killings classified as "crimes against humanity"

**"Auto-genocide" concept**:
- Term used because regime killed its own national group
- Some scholars reject "genocide" label since intent to destroy specific ethnic group not proven for majority of deaths
- Others argue scale and intent qualify regardless of technical definition

### Role of US Bombing

**View that US bears significant responsibility**:
- Ben Kiernan: Khmer Rouge "would not have won power without U.S. economic and military destabilization"
- William Shawcross: Bombing "plunged Cambodia into the chaos that Sihanouk had worked for years to avoid"
- Bombing killed civilians, destroyed rural society, drove recruits to KR

**More nuanced view**:
- Craig Etcheson: US intervention increased KR recruitment but "was not a primary cause" of victory
- David P. Chandler: Bombing "broke the Communist encirclement" but also "accelerated the collapse of rural society"

**Scholarly consensus**: US actions contributed to conditions enabling KR rise, but genocide itself was KR decision enabled by Chinese support

### Was it "True Communism"?

**Communist interpretation**:
- KR claimed Marxist-Leninist/Maoist ideology
- Class struggle rhetoric, collectivization, party dictatorship
- Chinese Communist Party provided 90%+ of foreign aid

**Alternative interpretations**:
- Ben Kiernan: Better understood through lens of "xenophobic European nationalism"
- Emphasized agrarianism and "Great Cambodia" over Marxist theory
- Michael Vickery: Bottom-up peasant revolution; KR leaders "romanticised" rural poor but didn't anticipate violence
- Some argue ideology was cover for ultranationalism and power

### Death Toll Methodology

**Sources of uncertainty**:
- Limited documentation during regime
- PRK government initially inflated numbers (double-counting)
- Different methodologies produce different results
- Distinction between violent deaths, famine deaths, disease deaths
- Baseline population estimates vary

**Heuveline's analysis**: Evaluated 12 most-cited estimates, found "striking methodological errors" in highest (3.3 million) and lowest (700,000) estimates

## Comparisons
- [[china-mao]] — relationship: ideological influence (Maoism); structural (communist model)
- [[soviet-union-stalin]] — relationship: structural (communist party state model)
- [[germany-hitler]] — relationship: thematic (genocide comparison; totalitarian control)

## Confidence Assessment
**Overall**: Medium-High

**Well-documented**:
- Basic timeline and key events
- Existence and location of S-21 and Killing Fields
- Tribunal proceedings and convictions
- US bombing campaign scope
- Vietnamese invasion and aftermath
- Key leadership figures and their roles

**Moderate uncertainty**:
- Exact death toll (scholarly range 1.2-2.8 million reflects genuine methodological challenges)
- Proportions killed by execution vs. starvation vs. disease
- Precise ethnic minority death counts
- Full extent of surveillance apparatus

**Ongoing scholarly debate**:
- Whether "genocide" label applies to non-ethnic killings
- Degree to which US bombing contributed to KR rise
- Ideological classification (communist vs. nationalist)
- Intentionality vs. incompetence in mass deaths

---

## Pre-Conditions

### Structural Factors

1. **Ottoman legacy** - Albania remained an Ottoman province until 1912; weak state institutions
2. **Extreme poverty** - one of Europe's poorest nations; 80-85% illiteracy rate
3. **Feudal social structure** - large landowners controlled 52% of agricultural land
4. **No industrial working class** - minimal proletariat for communist movement to organize
5. **Weak monarchy** - King Zog I's authoritarian but ineffective rule (1928-1939)

### Immediate Triggers

1. **Italian invasion (April 1939)** - Mussolini's forces conquered Albania in one week; King Zog fled
2. **Italian/German occupation (1939-1944)** - created power vacuum and resistance conditions
3. **Yugoslav communist patronage** - Yugoslav partisans helped establish Albanian Communist Party (November 1941)
4. **World War II resistance** - Communist-led National Liberation Movement gained legitimacy through anti-fascist struggle

### Enabling Conditions

- Absence of strong alternative political forces
- British aid to communist partisans as most effective resistance
- Civil war victory over nationalist Balli Kombëtar forces (1943-1944)
- German withdrawal (November 1944) left communists in control

---

## Rise to Power

### Formation of Communist Movement (1941-1943)

- **November 8, 1941**: Albanian Communist Party founded in Tirana with 130 members
- Yugoslav communists installed the "politically inexperienced" Hoxha as leader, believing he would be easier to control than Moscow-trained communists
- **March 1943**: Hoxha officially elected First Secretary

### Partisan War (1942-1944)

- Early 1942: Small partisan detachments formed in southern Albania
- September 1942: Corovode region became first "liberated territory"
- End of 1942: 8,000-10,000 guerrilla fighters
- **July 1943**: National Liberation Army (NLA) formally established; Hoxha as political commissar
- Summer 1943: Italian collapse - almost all mountainous interior under partisan control

### Civil War and Seizure of Power (1943-1944)

- September 1943: Italian armistice triggered civil war with nationalist Balli Kombëtar
- **May 29, 1944**: Congress of Permet established Anti-Fascist Council; Hoxha became chairman
- Mid-summer 1944: Communist partisans defeated last nationalist forces
- **November 1944**: German withdrawal; Hoxha's forces entered Tirana
- Albania and Yugoslavia were the only Eastern European countries to achieve liberation relatively independently of the Red Army

### Consolidation (1944-1950)

- 1945-1946: Extrajudicial killings and executions targeting anti-communists
- Number executed by military courts in 1945 was 2.7x higher than Italians killed during entire 1939-1943 occupation
- August 1945: Agrarian Reform Law - confiscated land from large landowners
- 1946: Collectivization commenced

---

## Methods of Control

### The Sigurimi (Secret Police)

The Drejtoria e Sigurimit te Shtetit (Directorate of State Security), known as **Sigurimi**, was "one of the most feared and repressive agencies to ever exist."

**Scale of Operations:**
- Every third Albanian citizen either served time in labor camps or was interrogated
- ~14,000 classified employees and collaborators
- 212,000 paper files containing ~20 million documents

**Methods:**
- Extensive telephone monitoring and surveillance
- Buildings, offices, and foreign embassies bugged
- Sophisticated spy tradecraft (e.g., creating replica shoes with hidden bugs)
- "Whisper networks" - family members spied on each other ("brother spied on his brother")
- Collective punishment - entire families punished for one member's dissent
- Children of dissidents denied education, assigned to mines and heavy industry

### Prison and Labor Camp System

**Infrastructure:**
- 23 prisons and 48 internment camps
- System modeled on Stalin's gulag

**Spaç Prison** (1968-1991) - Most notorious facility:
- Located at copper/pyrite mine in remote mountains
- 1,200-1,400 political prisoners at any time
- Harsh forced labor with minimal safety, extreme temperatures
- Overcrowded, unheated cells
- **May 21, 1973**: Prisoner uprising - rare act of resistance; brutally suppressed, leaders executed
- Described as "the most terrible camp in Europe and I think in the world during this period"

### Purges

Regular purges targeted:
- Pro-Yugoslav elements (1948-1954) - Koçi Xoxe and 100+ purged
- Pro-Soviet elements (after 1961)
- Pro-Chinese elements (after 1978)
- At least 170 Politburo/Central Committee members executed

**Notable pattern:** Hoxha killed all but one of his Ministers of Interior

### Propaganda and Ideological Control

**Education System:**
- Centralized government control of all aspects
- Purpose: ideological indoctrination + economic production
- 1967: Mass destruction of textbooks with "idealistic and theological theories"
- 1969: Education reform emphasizing productive labor and military training

**Youth Organizations:**
- Labor Youth Union of Albania as "revolutionizing shock force"
- Students mobilized for anti-religious campaign

**Intellectual Repression:**
- High distrust of intelligentsia
- 1966: Intellectuals and writers sent to countryside for "re-education through labor"
- 1973: Crackdown on Western dress, hair, and music among youth

### Border Control

- Borders sealed with electric fences
- Shoot-to-kill orders for escape attempts
- Citizens executed for attempting to flee
- Often compared to North Korea for isolation

---

## Isolation Policy

### Break with Yugoslavia (1948)

**Background:**
- 1944-1948: Albania was Yugoslav "sub-satellite"
- Treaty of Friendship (1946) aimed to integrate economies
- Pro-Yugoslav faction (led by Koçi Xoxe) sought Albania as Yugoslavia's "Seventh Republic"

**Trigger:**
- Tito-Stalin split (June 1948) - Cominform expelled Yugoslav Communist Party
- Hoxha sided with Stalin to preserve power against pro-Yugoslav rivals

**Consequences:**
- July 1, 1948: Albanian Central Committee condemned Yugoslavia's "betrayal of Marxism-Leninism"
- All Yugoslav citizens and military expelled
- Border sealed for 40+ years
- Koçi Xoxe executed (1949)
- 100+ pro-Yugoslav sympathizers purged

### Break with Soviet Union (1956-1961)

**Causes:**
- Khrushchev's "Secret Speech" (1956) and de-Stalinization
- Soviet rapprochement with Yugoslavia (Hoxha's enemy)
- Hoxha perceived de-Stalinization as threat to personal rule and Albanian security

**Key Events:**
- 1956: Hoxha rejected de-Stalinization
- June 1960: Bucharest Conference - Albanian delegation (led by Hysni Kapo) sided with China against Khrushchev
- October 1960: Hoxha and Khrushchev exchanged accusations at Moscow Communist Party meeting
- October 1961: Khrushchev criticized Albania at 22nd CPSU Congress
- November 1961: Hoxha's famous statement - Albanians would "eat grass" rather than "sell themselves for thirty silverlings"
- **December 1961**: USSR broke diplomatic relations; withdrew advisers, technicians, and aid; closed Vlore naval base

**Result:** Albania became only European ally of Communist China

### Break with China (1971-1978)

**Background:**
- 1960-1978: China replaced USSR as Albania's patron
- Albania heavily dependent on Chinese economic aid

**Causes:**
- July 1971: Kissinger's secret visit to China - Hoxha saw this as "betrayal of Marxist ideology"
- Nixon's 1972 visit to China
- Mao's death (September 1976) and new leadership under Hua Guofeng
- 1977: China adopted "Three World Theory" - Hoxha opposed as alliance with US against USSR
- August-September 1977: Tito visited Beijing - Albania declared China "revisionist"

**The Break:**
- **July 13, 1978**: China announced cessation of aid
- July 29, 1978: Hoxha's letter to Hua condemned China's post-Mao policies
- After 1979: All trade, cultural, educational, and technological relations suspended

**Result:** Complete isolation; Albania attempted autarky

### Autarky and Total Isolation (1978-1991)

- **1976 Constitution**: Banned foreign aid, credits, and joint ventures with capitalist or "revisionist" countries
- "Albanian model" - national self-reliance as guiding principle
- Attempted near-total food self-sufficiency
- International isolation deepened economic decline
- Albania became "third poorest country in the world" with average income of $15/month

---

### Legacy of Persecution

- 50,000 people imprisoned for political reasons
- 5,577 men and 450 women executed

- 17,900 imprisoned for combined 914,000 years
- ~2,700 former political prisoners still alive (as of recent estimates)
- 4,000+ still missing - believed buried in mass graves
- Excavations continue to locate victims' remains

### Religious Revival

## Scholarly Debate

### Key Historiographical Questions

1. **Nature of Hoxha's rule**: Was Albania's communism uniquely repressive even by Stalinist standards?
2. **Mehmet Shehu's death**: Suicide or murder? Modern scholarship favors "victimized by Hoxha's paranoia" interpretation
3. **Economic achievements**: Did Hoxha's industrialization and literacy programs offset human rights abuses?
4. **Causes of isolation**: Ideological rigidity vs. genuine security concerns vs. personal paranoia?
5. **Legacy and memory**: How should Albania remember/commemorate the communist period?

### Major Academic Works

- **Blendi Fevziu**, *Enver Hoxha: The Iron Fist of Albania* (2016) - definitive biography using new archival sources
- **Bernd J. Fischer**, "Enver Hoxha and the Stalinist Dictatorship in Albania" in *Balkan Strongmen* (2007)
- **Idrit Idrizi**, "Enver Hoxha's Last Purge: Inside the Ruling Circle of Communist Albania (1981-1983)" (2022) - archival study of final purges

### Points of Scholarly Consensus

- Albania experienced "one of the most repressive communist dictatorships in Central and Eastern Europe"
- Hoxha was "a master of crisis and a state of emergency" like Stalin
- The regime used historical events as "ideological tools" for class struggle narratives
- Complete isolation was unique in Europe outside North Korea

### Continuing Debates

- Role of "Hoxhaism" in international communist movement (influenced movements in Ethiopia, Latin America)
- Extent of genuine popular support vs. coerced compliance
- Assessment of Alia: reformer or continuity with repression?

### Albanian Public Opinion (2016 IDRA Survey)

- 45% believed Hoxha had positive impact on Albanian history
- 42% believed he had negative impact
- Generational divide: younger generations (post-1981) more negative; older generations more positive

## Pre-Conditions

### The Guatemalan Civil War (1960-1996)
The Guatemalan Civil War had its roots in the 1954 CIA-backed coup that overthrew President Jacobo Arbenz. Arbenz had implemented land reforms (Decree 900) that threatened the interests of the United Fruit Company and Guatemalan elites.

**1954 Coup and Its Aftermath**:
- The CIA's Operation PBSUCCESS overthrew the democratically elected Arbenz government
- Carlos Castillo Armas became dictator, reversing land reforms and banning labor unions
- Political instability and inequality sparked leftist insurgency beginning in 1960
- The overthrow of Arbenz deepened Guatemala's structural inequalities, sparking a civil war that lasted 36 years

**Guerrilla Insurgency**:
- Rebel groups included the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP), Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA), Rebel Armed Forces (FAR), and Guatemalan Labor Party (PGT)
- In 1982, these groups unified as the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG)
- Guerrillas operated primarily in rural, indigenous highland regions
- The insurgency never posed an existential threat to the state but provided justification for military campaigns

### Prior Military Governments

**Romeo Lucas Garcia (1978-1982)**:
- General Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia served as president from July 1, 1978 to March 23, 1982
- His brother Benedicto Lucas Garcia served as Army Chief of Staff
- Initiated early scorched earth campaigns and organized first civilian paramilitary patrols
- Under Lucas Garcia (March 1981-March 1982), 2,495 Maya were victims of 97 army massacres in El Quiche department
- Regime was marked by extreme corruption and fraudulent 1982 election

**Electoral Fraud Crisis (March 1982)**:
- On March 7, 1982, General Angel Anibal Guevara was declared winner of presidential election
- All opposition parties denounced the result as fraudulent
- Electoral fraud created conditions for coup by discontented junior officers

---

## Rise to Power

### The March 23, 1982 Coup

**Planning**:
- Dissatisfied junior army and air force officers who wanted free elections and a civilian president began planning a coup
- Approximately 19 military officers participated in plotting over eight days
- The plotters called themselves "oficiales jovenes" (young officers)
- Rios Montt himself did not actively participate in the coup planning

**Execution**:
- On March 23, 1982, the coup was launched at around 4 AM
- A 2,000-strong rebel force surrounded the presidential palace
- The coup was nearly bloodless
- President Lucas Garcia was forced to resign
- General Guevara was prevented from assuming the presidency he had fraudulently won

**Installation of Rios Montt**:
- Though not a coup participant, Rios Montt was invited to lead the new government
- He had credibility as a victim of electoral fraud himself (his apparent 1974 presidential victory was annulled)
- A three-person military junta was installed: General Rios Montt (presiding), General Horacio Maldonado Schaad, and Colonel Luis Gordillo Martinez

**Consolidation of Power**:
- In June 1982, Rios Montt dismissed the other junta members
- He assumed the de facto title of "President of the Republic"
- He annulled the 1965 constitution, dissolved Congress, suspended political parties, and canceled the electoral law
- Combined religious fundamentalism with military rule (he was a convert to evangelical Protestantism)

---

## Methods of Control

### Scorched Earth Campaign

**Strategy**:
- In April 1982, Rios Montt launched a "scorched earth" operation against the Maya
- The strategy was known as "fusiles y frijoles" (rifles and beans) — military destruction combined with food aid to compliant communities
- Armed forces cordoned off villages, rounded up inhabitants, separated men from women, and killed them
- Over 600 villages were systematically destroyed

**Operation Sofia (July-October 1982)**:
- Ordered by Army Chief of Staff Hector Mario Lopez Fuentes on July 8, 1982
- Planned and executed by the 1st Battalion of the Guatemalan Airborne Troops
- Mission was to "exterminate the subversive elements in the area — Quiche"
- A 359-page operational plan documented the campaign
- Targeted the Ixil Maya region in northwestern Quiche department
- Resulted in the massacre of thousands of noncombatant civilians

**Scale of Destruction**:
- In April 1982 alone (Rios Montt's first full month), the military committed 3,330 documented killings — approximately 111 per day
- Under Rios Montt (March 1982-March 1983), 3,180 Maya were victims of 85 massacres in El Quiche alone
- Between 1981-1983, over 400 villages were destroyed
- 75,000 people killed in 1982-1983
- 1 million people displaced internally
- 150,000+ fled to Mexico as refugees

### The Kaibiles (Special Forces)

**Background**:
- Created in 1974 as Guatemala's elite special operations force
- Named after Kayb'il B'alam, a Mam indigenous leader who evaded Spanish capture
- Training facility located in "El Infierno" (Hell), La Polvora, Peten

**Training Methods**:
- The UN Commission for Historical Clarification called attention to the "brutalizing nature" of Kaibil training
- Training included killing animals and eating them raw, drinking their blood
- Extreme cruelty of training methods was then applied in operations
- Kaibil decalogue stated: "The Kaibil is a killing machine"

**Role in Atrocities**:
- Kaibiles committed numerous massacres during the civil war
- Responsible for the Dos Erres massacre (December 1982)
- Used as shock troops in scorched earth campaigns

### Civil Defense Patrols (PAC)

**Establishment**:
- Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil (PAC) officially created by decree of Rios Montt on August 1, 1982
- Had begun informally under Lucas Garcia
- Recruited and organized at village level

**Forced Participation**:
- Officially "voluntary" but participation was mandatory under threat of death or disappearance
- Male community members forced to serve without pay
- PACs grew from 30,000 members in 1982 to 700,000 in 1983 to 1.3 million by 1984
- Men forced to patrol for guerrillas, serving as human shields against insurgent attacks

**Control Function**:
- PACs enforced population control in rural areas
- Forced to participate in violence against neighbors
- Created collective complicity in atrocities
- Military commissioners exercised significant power within militarized communities

### Model Villages (Polos de Desarrollo)

**Concept**:
- Strategic hamlets modeled on U.S. Vietnam War program
- Part of the "guns and beans" counterinsurgency approach
- Displaced populations forcibly resettled into army-controlled settlements
- Major expansion under Development Pole program launched late 1983

**Conditions**:
- Inhabitants subjected to heightened surveillance
- Required to live in specific areas and publicly present themselves when traveling
- Underwent forced "reeducation" and religious conversions
- Subject to constant control by armed forces and PACs
- Some communities converted entirely into "military colonies"

**Example — Choatalum**:
- Converted into model village under rifles and beans program
- Food provided to communities pledging allegiance to military
- Anyone else threatened with death

### Media Control and Propaganda

**Information Control**:
- Sunday television addresses by Rios Montt combining evangelical sermons with political messages
- Press restricted in access to conflict zones
- State narrative denied genocide and presented campaign as counterinsurgency

**Religious Dimension**:
- Rios Montt was a member of the California-based Church of the Word (Iglesia del Verbo), a charismatic evangelical sect
- His religious fundamentalism permeated governance
- Sunday sermons broadcast nationally
- Presented military campaign in religious/moral terms
- Religious zeal alienated predominantly Catholic population and ruling elite

## Scholarly Debate

### Genocide Classification

**Arguments Supporting Genocide Determination**:
- CEH found systematic targeting of Maya as ethnic group, not just political opponents
- Massacres were not rogue actions but systematic institutional strategy
- Operation Sofia documents explicitly stated goal to "exterminate" population
- 83% of victims were indigenous Maya
- Attacks on culture, language, religion as indicators of genocidal intent
- Inter-American Court ruling acknowledged genocide
- Guatemalan court conviction (though overturned)

**Arguments Against Genocide Classification**:
- Some scholars argue deaths were political (counterinsurgency) not ethnic targeting
- Anthropologist David Stoll noted that until 1980, majority of victims were non-indigenous Ladinos
- When Mayan villages targeted, Ladino villages not spared, suggesting class not ethnicity was primary factor
- Critics argue conflict was political (left vs. right) not ethnic
- Comparison to Rwanda seen as inapt by some scholars

**Current Scholarly Consensus**:
- Most scholars and international bodies accept genocide classification
- UN truth commission, Inter-American Court, and Guatemalan court all found genocide
- Debate continues over whether military intended ethnic destruction or merely saw Maya as guerrilla supporters
- Legal distinction between motive (counterinsurgency) and intent (destroying ethnic group) is central

### U.S. Role and Complicity

**Documented U.S. Support**:
- Reagan administration praised Rios Montt as dealing effectively with corruption
- December 1982: Reagan met Rios Montt, claimed he was getting "bum rap" on human rights
- January 7, 1983: Reagan lifted five-year arms embargo on Guatemala
- Authorized sale of $6 million in military aid
- $4 million in helicopter spare parts and $6.3 million in additional supplies (1982-1983)
- Six of Rios Montt's top nine generals trained at School of the Americas

**Context**:
- Reagan administration fighting covert war against Nicaraguan Sandinistas
- Guatemala seen as ally against communism in Central America
- State Department memo before Reagan-Rios Montt meeting: coup presented "opportunity to break the long freeze in our relations"

**Human Rights Dispute**:
- Assistant Secretary Elliott Abrams claimed political killings had reduced under Rios Montt
- Human rights groups and some members of Congress disputed this
- Administration refused to acknowledge army role in civilian massacres
- Carter administration had imposed arms embargo due to human rights violations

**Scholarly Assessment**:
- U.S. training of Guatemalan officers contributed to human rights violations (per CEH)
- Debate over degree of direct U.S. knowledge versus willful blindness
- CIA and military intelligence aware of ongoing massacres
- U.S. prioritized anti-communism over human rights concerns

### Roots of Violence: 1954 Coup Legacy

**Historical Continuity Arguments**:
- 1954 CIA coup against Arbenz created conditions for civil war
- Reversal of land reform deepened inequality
- Destroyed democratic institutions
- Created pattern of military intervention
- Generated "anti-communist paranoia" that fueled later repression

**Counter-Arguments**:
- Other Latin American countries experienced similar Cold War dynamics without genocide
- Indigenous communities were not initially primary guerrilla supporters
- Insurgency had roots beyond 1954 coup

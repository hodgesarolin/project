2. **No free elections**: No competitive multi-party elections held during Castro's rule
3. **Suppression of dissent**: Systematic imprisonment, torture, and execution of political opponents
4. **Media control**: All media state-owned and controlled; independent journalism criminalized
5. **No freedom of assembly or association**: Civil society organizations banned except those aligned with the state
6. **Cult of personality**: Fidel Castro as maximum leader ("El Comandante"), though less extreme than some regimes
7. **Economic control**: Nationalization of virtually all private enterprise; state-controlled economy

## Achievements and Controversies

### Healthcare

- Healthcare extended to rural areas (previously concentrated in Havana)
- 13 medical schools training surplus of physicians
- 50,000 health professionals sent abroad annually, including 25,000 physicians
- Free universal healthcare

**Criticisms/Context:**
- Cuba already had one of Latin America's best healthcare systems in 1950s
- Life expectancy gains similar to other Latin American countries (Chile, Costa Rica caught up)
- Accusations of hiding infant deaths and exaggerating life expectancy statistics
- Severe shortages of medicines and equipment, especially after Soviet collapse
- Two-tier system: Better facilities for tourists and elite; poor conditions for ordinary Cubans

### Literacy and Education
**Claims/Achievements:**
- **1961 Literacy Campaign**: 200,000 volunteers taught 700,000 people to read
- Illiteracy reduced from ~23% (41.7% rural) to 3.9% by 1962
- Current literacy rate: 99.8% (among world's highest)
- Free education through university level
- Schools built in rural areas where none existed

**Criticisms/Context:**
- Cuba already had 77% literacy in 1959 (among highest in Latin America)
- Education heavily ideological; curriculum promotes revolutionary doctrine
- Academic freedom suppressed; professors must conform to party line

**Criticisms:**
- Women underrepresented in top political leadership
- Racial inequality persists in practice; Afro-Cubans disproportionately poor
- Afro-Cuban culture suppressed as "counter-revolutionary" in early years

## Opposition & Resistance

### Internal Opposition
- **Huber Matos**: Revolutionary commander arrested October 1959 for objecting to communist direction; served 20 years

- **Dissidents**: Oswaldo Paya (Varela Project), Martha Beatriz Roque, and others
- **Escambray Rebels**: Peasant farmers who resisted collectivization (1960-65)

### Exile Community
- **Cuban American National Foundation**: Powerful anti-Castro lobby group
- **Alpha 66**: Paramilitary exile organization

### What Happened to Opposition
- Execution (especially 1959-1960s)
- Long-term imprisonment (often 20+ years)
- Forced exile
- Internal exile (sent to remote areas)
- "Acts of repudiation" (organized mob harassment)

- **February 19, 2008**: Fidel announced resignation as President and Commander-in-Chief
- **February 24, 2008**: Raul formally elected President by National Assembly
- **Fidel's Death**: November 25, 2016

### Regime Continuity

- Miguel Diaz-Canel became President (2018) and Communist Party First Secretary (2021)
- System fundamentally unchanged despite limited economic reforms

## Aftermath

### Under Raul Castro (2008-2018/2021)
- Limited economic reforms (small private businesses, real estate sales)
- Diplomatic normalization with U.S. under Obama (2014-2016)
- Eased restrictions on technology, travel

### Ongoing Issues
- Economic hardship; severe shortages
- Continued political repression
- Emigration continues
- Embargo remains in place
- COVID-19 pandemic created additional hardships
- Unprecedented protests (July 2021) met with mass arrests

## Scholarly Debate

### Contested Areas

**Revolution's Legitimacy:**
- **Sympathizers**: Popular revolution against U.S.-backed dictator; genuine social transformation
- **Critics**: Communist takeover that betrayed democratic promises of 26th of July Movement
- **Key Question**: Was Castro always communist, or did he radicalize after taking power?

**Human Rights vs. Social Achievements:**
- **Defenders**: Healthcare and education gains justify some restrictions; U.S. embargo caused hardships
- **Critics**: No social achievement justifies systematic repression; achievements exaggerated or existed pre-revolution
- **Key Question**: Do healthcare/literacy gains outweigh political repression?

**Death Toll and Repression:**
- Wide variation in estimates (5,000 to 100,000 depending on methodology and what's counted)
- Cuba Archive documents approximately 11,000 deaths
- Debate over how to count deaths at sea, in foreign interventions, from economic hardship

**U.S. Role:**
- **One View**: U.S. hostility (embargo, Bay of Pigs, assassination attempts) forced Castro toward repression and USSR
- **Other View**: Castro's communist ideology predetermined his path; U.S. responding to genuine threat
- **Key Question**: How much of Cuba's problems stem from embargo vs. systemic failures?

**Legacy Assessment:**
- **Mark White**: Emphasizes "corrupting influence of power"
- **Andrew Roberts**: Despite social claims, "reign ultimately led to a decrease in average income and widespread human rights violations"
- **Julie Bunck**: Notes "failed attempts to instill a revolutionary conscience in Cuban society"
- **Sebastian Balfour**: Criticizes narrow economic lens in analyzing Cuba
- **Julia Sweig**: Revisionist work challenges "official story" of guerrilla victory; emphasizes urban underground role

**Historiographical Issues:**
- Limited access to Cuban archives constrains scholarship
- Post-1959 Cuban historiography heavily influenced by revolutionary narrative
- No significant "exile school" of Cuban historians has emerged
- Recent scholarship emphasizes previously neglected groups (women, Afro-Cubans, workers)

### Academic Consensus Points
- Castro regime was authoritarian/dictatorial by standard definitions
- Significant human rights violations occurred, especially 1959-1970s
- Some social gains in healthcare and literacy (though extent debated)
- Cold War context shaped both Castro's policies and U.S. response
- Exile community's accounts and Cuban government's accounts both contain biases

## Comparisons
- [[chile-pinochet]] - Cold War Latin American dictatorship (right-wing counterpart)
- [[north-korea-kim-dynasty]] - Communist personalist dynasty
- [[argentina-junta]] - Latin American military repression
- [[spain-franco]] - Long-lasting personalist rule

- Accuracy of Cuban government health/education statistics
- Camilo Cienfuegos death (accident vs. assassination)
- Castro's ideological trajectory (always communist vs. radicalized)
- Relative weight of achievements vs. repression in evaluating regime

**Sources of Uncertainty:**
- Cuban government archives largely closed to researchers
- Exile community accounts may be biased by political opposition
- Cuban government statistics may be manipulated
- Cold War propaganda from both sides distorts historical record
- Many witnesses have died; others remain afraid to speak

## Pre-Conditions

### Japanese Colonial Rule (1910-1945)
Korea suffered 35 years of harsh Japanese occupation that shaped its post-war trajectory:

**Political Suppression**:
- Complete annexation in 1910 following years of war, intimidation, and political manipulation [Source: [HISTORY](https://www.history.com/articles/japan-colonization-korea)]
- First ten years under direct military rule; any Korean dissent ruthlessly crushed [Source: [Columbia University](https://afe.easia.columbia.edu/main_pop/kpct/kp_1900-1950.htm)]
- March 1, 1919 Independence Movement brutally suppressed, spurring overseas resistance movements

**Cultural Destruction**:
- Japanese authorities worked to wipe out Korean culture, language, and history [Source: [Korea Society](https://www.koreasociety.org/images/pdf/KoreanStudies/Monographs_LessonPlans/High_School/5%20The%20Japanese%20Occupation%20of%20Korea%201910-1945.pdf)]
- Teaching of Korean language and history banned; many historical documents burned
- 1940: Koreans forced to adopt Japanese names; children barred from school without compliance

**Economic Exploitation**:
- Industrial development primarily to enrich Japan and support wars in China and the Pacific
- By 1945, Korea was second-most industrialized nation in Asia after Japan itself
- Infrastructure development served Japanese interests, not Korean welfare
- Heavy industry concentrated in the north (later North Korea) [Source: [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Korea/Korea-under-Japanese-rule)]

**Forced Labor and "Comfort Women"**:
- From 1939-1945, close to one million Korean youths shipped to mines and factories in Japan
- Thousands of Korean women forced into sexual slavery as "comfort women" for Japanese military
- Korean population in Japan jumped from 690,502 in 1939 to 2,400,000 by 1945 [Source: [Columbia University](https://afe.easia.columbia.edu/main_pop/kpct/ct_korea.htm)]

**Legacy**:
The colonial experience left Korea with:
- Deep trauma and unresolved grievances against Japan
- A generation of Korean collaborators who would later serve in post-war governments
- Divided society between collaborators and resistance fighters
- Industrial infrastructure but severe economic distortion

### Division at the 38th Parallel (1945)

**The Hasty Decision**:
- On August 10, 1945, two young US officers - Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel - were assigned to define American occupation zone
- Working on extremely short notice and completely unprepared, they used a National Geographic map
- Chose 38th parallel because it divided the country approximately in half and placed Seoul under American control
- No experts on Korea were consulted
- Rusk later learned Japan and pre-revolutionary Russia had discussed the same division 40 years earlier; he said he "almost surely" would have chosen a different line [Source: [NEH](https://www.neh.gov/article/korea-and-thirty-eighth-parallel)]

**Population Distribution**:
- Division placed 16 million Koreans in the American zone (south)
- 9 million Koreans in the Soviet zone (north)
- Industrial facilities concentrated in the north; agricultural land in the south

**Implementation**:
- September 7, 1945: General Douglas MacArthur issued Proclamation No. 1, announcing US military control south of 38th parallel
- English declared official language during military control
- Lt. General John R. Hodge appointed to administer Korean affairs
- May 1946: Crossing the 38th parallel without permit made illegal [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Korea)]

**Intended as Temporary**:
The line was meant to be a temporary administrative boundary for accepting Japanese surrender, but the onset of the Cold War transformed it into a permanent division [Source: [HISTORY](https://www.history.com/articles/north-south-korea-divided-reasons-facts)]

### US Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK, 1945-1948)

**Unprepared Administration**:
- United States had little interest in Korea; relied on MacArthur who was overloaded with Japan occupation
- MacArthur ordered Hodge to maintain a "harsh" occupation of Korea
- Four days before arriving, Hodge told his officers Korea "was an enemy of the United States"
- September 9, 1945: Hodge announced Japanese colonial government would remain intact, including personnel
- After outcry, replaced governor-general with American but kept Japanese bureaucrats as advisors [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Military_Government_in_Korea)]

**Alignment with Wealthy Anti-Communists**:
- Hodge's most significant contribution: alignment of military government with Korea's wealthy anti-Communist faction
- Promoted men who had previously collaborated with the Japanese into positions of authority
- USAMGIK recruited former Japanese collaborators as police chiefs and administrative staff
- Relied on wealthy landlords and businessmen who could speak English for advice [Source: [Lumen Learning](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-worldhistory/chapter/35-3-2-occupation-by-the-us-and-ussr/)]

**Suppression of Left-Wing Organizations**:
- Military government banned popular organizations suspected of communist alignment
- Banned the People's Republic of Korea despite its relatively moderate stance
- December 8, 1945: USAMGIK banned strikes
- December 12, 1945: Outlawed people's committees
- Set up right-leaning Korean Federation of Labor Unions for Independence to counter leftist unions

**1946 Autumn Uprising**:
- September 1946: Communist Party initiated General Strike starting among Busan railway workers
- Over 250,000 workers joined the strike
- October 1: Strike protest in Daegu fired on by police; worker killed
- US administration declared martial law, fired into crowds, killed unknown number
- USAMGIK encouraged right-wing anti-communist groups to oppose strikers [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Military_Government_in_Korea)]

- Most importantly, Rhee spoke fluent English - none of his rivals did
- Therefore most trusted and favored by American occupation government
- Strong anti-communist credentials aligned with US Cold War priorities

- October 12, 1948: Soviet Union recognized North Korea as sovereign government of entire peninsula [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Republic_of_Korea)]

**Competing Legitimacy**:
Both Korean states claimed sovereignty over the entire peninsula, setting the stage for the Korean War.

## Methods of Control

### The National Security Law (1948)

**Origins and Enactment**:
- Enacted December 1, 1948, months after ROK establishment and before Korean War
- Roots in Japanese colonial security law used to suppress pro-independence activists during occupation
- Passed after October 1948 Yeosu-Suncheon rebellion and communist infiltration of military [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Act_(South_Korea))]

**Purpose**:
- Stated purpose: "to secure the security of the State and the subsistence and freedom of nationals"
- Actual function: "legal expression of anti-communism and anti-North Korea ideology"
- Became "institutional backbone of anti-communism since 1948" [Source: [Korea Economic Institute](https://keia.org/the-peninsula/the-enduring-consequences-of-south-koreas-national-security-law/)]

**Scope and Abuse**:
- Behavior or speeches in favor of North Korea or communism punishable
- Used to oppress political opposition, not just genuine security threats
- Allowed prosecution for vague offenses like "benefiting the enemy"
- Constitution nominally guaranteed freedoms, but NSL rendered them meaningless [Source: [University of Kentucky](https://uknowledge.uky.edu/law_facpub/494/)]

**Anti-Communist Tool**:
- Hindered development of party politics based on social cleavages
- Military regimes used NSL to block political critiques and exclude socialist parties
- Equated with national identity and basic doctrine of state
- October 2004: Amnesty International officially called for law's repeal [Source: [SpringerOpen](https://ajges.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40856-017-0015-4)]

### Police State Apparatus

**Continuity with Colonial System**:
- USAMGIK retained Japanese colonial police structure
- Many Korean police had served under Japanese occupation
- Methods of surveillance, interrogation, and control carried over from colonial era

**Intelligence and Surveillance**:
- Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) and special police units for political control
- Networks of informants throughout society
- Arbitrary arrests and detention without trial

**Paramilitary Groups**:
- Right-wing youth groups (like Northwest Youth League) used for violent suppression
- These groups participated in Jeju massacre and other atrocities
- Government provided cover and impunity for their actions

### Press Control

**Legal Framework**:
- Continued US Military Government Ordinance No. 88 outlawing leftist newspapers
- 1958: National Security Act revision strengthened press restrictions
- Clause 22: Those using documents or any means to defame "constitutional organization" could face up to 10 years in prison [Source: [Korea Herald](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3048209)]

**Kyunghyang Shinmun Closure (1959)**:
- Catholic-founded newspaper critical of Rhee regime
- May 1959: Rhee administration revoked publishing license
- Government claimed "false editorials" threatened social order
- Actually political retaliation for critical reporting
- Revived only after April Revolution of 1960 [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyunghyang_Shinmun)]

**Pattern of Suppression**:
- Rhee closed moderate newspapers repeatedly
- Arrested reporters and publishers on numerous occasions (1948-1960)
- Judiciary failed to check executive's press suppression
- Press crackdown peaked before 1960 election [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press_in_South_Korea)]

**Near Defeat**:
- North Korean forces pushed UN/ROK forces to Pusan Perimeter in southeast
- South Korea nearly lost entirely within weeks

**The Inchon Landing (September 15-26, 1950)**:
- MacArthur's daring amphibious assault at Inchon, 110 miles behind enemy lines
- Military authorities doubted plan could succeed due to extreme tides (30-foot variation)
- September 15: 1st Marine Division assaulted three beaches, quickly seized Inchon
- September 28: UN forces captured Seoul
- Within a month, 135,000 North Korean troops captured
- "The Navy and Marines... never shone more brightly" - MacArthur [Source: [Navy History](https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/wars-conflicts-and-operations/korean-war/korea-operations/inchon.html)]

### Chinese Intervention

**The Push North**:
- After Inchon success, some cautioned against crossing 38th parallel
- September 27, 1950: Joint Chiefs directed MacArthur to move north and destroy North Korean military
- MacArthur confident, downplayed Chinese intervention risk as UN forces approached Yalu River [Source: [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/Inchon-landing)]

**China Enters the War**:
- Late November 1950: China's People's Volunteer Army deployed approximately 150,000 troops
- Chinese intervention came as great surprise after Inchon optimism
- Chinese forces overran UN forces along Ch'ongch'on River
- Forced withdrawal after Battle of Chosin Reservoir [Source: [Eisenhower Library](https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/research/online-documents/korean-war)]

**Stalemate**:
- After Chinese intervention, war became stalemate near original 38th parallel line
- Battle lines remained relatively stable from July 1951 until war's end
- Truman abandoned plans to reunify Korea to avoid escalation with China and USSR

**MacArthur's Dismissal**:
- MacArthur publicly challenged Truman Administration's conduct of war
- April 1951: Truman relieved MacArthur of command
- Replaced by General Ridgway

### The Armistice (July 27, 1953)

**Negotiations**:
- Longest negotiated armistice in history: 158 meetings over two years and 17 days
- Major sticking point: repatriation of prisoners of war
- Communists held 10,000 POWs; UNC held 150,000
- Many communist POWs refused repatriation to the north [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement)]

**Breaking the Logjam**:
- President Eisenhower (elected 1952) visited Korea, determined to end stalemate
- Eisenhower publicly hinted US might use nuclear arsenal
- March 1953: Stalin's death helped spur negotiations
- New Soviet leadership called for quick end to hostilities [Source: [NPS](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/eisenhower-and-the-korean-war-armistice.htm)]

**The Signing**:
- July 27, 1953, 10 AM at Panmunjom
- US Army Lt. Gen. William K. Harrison Jr. and North Korean Gen. Nam Il signed 18 copies
- Scarcely acknowledged each other during signing
- Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (chaired by Indian general) handled POW issue [Source: [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/armistice-agreement-restoration-south-korean-state)]

**Not a Peace Treaty**:
- Armistice was military ceasefire, not peace treaty
- Intended to "insure a complete cessation of hostilities... until a final peaceful settlement is achieved"
- No peace treaty ever signed; North and South technically remain at war
- Division of Korea and geopolitical tensions persist to this day [Source: [Milwaukee Independent](https://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/articles/pause-without-peace-korean-war-armistice-silenced-guns-july-27-not-conflict/)]

## Constitutional Manipulation

### The 1952 Busan Political Crisis

**The Problem**:
- Rhee's first four-year term ending in August 1952
- Under 1948 constitution, president elected by National Assembly
- Obvious Rhee would lose if Assembly voted
- November 1951: Rhee proposed constitutional amendment for direct popular election
- Amendment resoundingly defeated 143 to 19 [Source: [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Korea/History)]

**Martial Law Coup**:
- May 1952: Rhee declared martial law in Busan (provisional wartime capital)
- Had members of National Assembly arrested
- Employed military police to hijack bus transporting legislators to Assembly
- Gathered legislators (some had been hiding) and brought to Assembly Hall [Source: [GlobalSecurity](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/rok/president-syngman-rhee.htm)]

**Forced Amendment**:
- Assembly Speaker Shin Ik-hee protested; Assembly demanded lifting of martial law
- Rhee refused to comply
- Under military siege, legislators yielded
- Constitutional amendment passed 163-0 (with 166 members present)
- No votes against under conditions of coercion [Source: [New World Encyclopedia](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Syngman_Rhee)]

**Result**:
- August 5, 1952: Rhee and running mate Ham T'ae-yong elected by popular vote
- Won overwhelming majority - but election conducted under martial law conditions

### The 1954 "Sasaogi" (Rounding) Amendment

**Term Limit Problem**:
- 1948 Constitution limited president to two terms
- Rhee approaching end of constitutionally permitted tenure
- November 1954: Proposed amendment to eliminate term limits for first president only [Source: [ConstitutionNet](https://constitutionnet.org/country/republic-korea)]

**The Fraudulent Vote**:
- Amendment required 2/3 majority of 203 assembly members
- 2/3 of 203 = 135.33 members
- Amendment received only 135 votes
- Initially declared failed [Source: [Korea Times](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/amp/southkorea/politics/20250519/history-of-koreas-constitutional-amendments)]

**Mathematical Manipulation**:
- Two days later, vote reversed using unprecedented mathematical argument
- Government claimed 135 was the "closest integer" to 135.33
- Therefore 2/3 majority achieved by "rounding down"
- Amendment passed without proper quorum, sparking public criticism [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_South_Korea)]

**Constitutional Significance**:
- This "Sasaogi" (rounding off) amendment became infamous example of constitutional manipulation
- Unlimited term provision applied only to first president (Rhee himself)
- Demonstrated regime's willingness to distort basic democratic principles
- Set precedent for future authoritarian constitutional manipulation in South Korea

## Economic Failure

### Failed Development Strategy

**Import Substitution Policy**:
- Rhee regime followed import substitution industrialization
- Imports blocked to protect domestic industries
- Policy not conducive to rapid development
- South Korea remained embarrassingly dependent on US [Source: [Association for Asian Studies](https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/an-unpromising-recovery-south-koreas-post-korean-war-economic-development-1953-1961/)]

**Overvalued Currency**:
- Rather than constructive development strategy, relied on overvalued currency
- Combined with low interest rates and elaborate government controls
- Created environment where corruption operated profitably
- Came at detriment of sound investments and national development [Source: [Country Studies](https://countrystudies.us/south-korea/11.htm)]

### Aid Dependency

**Massive US Support**:
- American aid at peak (mid-1950s) accounted for nearly 80% of all government revenues
- Substantial portion of South Korea's entire GNP
- Washington financed most of ROK operating budget
- US paid entire cost of South Korea's large military [Source: [University of Tennessee at Chattanooga](https://www.utc.edu/document/51826)]

**Comparative Aid Levels**:
- 1946-1976: US provided $12.6 billion in economic assistance to South Korea
- Only Israel and South Vietnam received more on per capita basis
- For comparison: $6.85 billion given to all of Africa in same period
- $14.89 billion for all of Latin America [Source: [Association for Asian Studies](https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/an-unpromising-recovery-south-koreas-post-korean-war-economic-development-1953-1961/)]

**"Rat Hole" Assessment**:
- American officials complained of aid funds misallocated for political purposes
- Apparent inability of Rhee administration to generate sustained economic growth
- Americans felt South Korea was a "rat hole" swallowing up assistance without progress [Source: [Country Studies](https://countrystudies.us/south-korea/11.htm)]

### Corruption

**Nature of Corruption**:
- Payoffs from foreign aid funds and bank loans
- Liberal Party had no real ideology other than perpetuating Rhee's rule
- Party members personally advanced political and economic fortunes through administration
- Small class of wealthy Koreans created at expense of majority [Source: [University of Tennessee at Chattanooga](https://www.utc.edu/document/51826)]

**Embezzlement**:
- Kim Yong Kap (Rhee's Deputy Minister of Finance) revealed Rhee embezzled $20 million in government funds
- American economic aid failed to create industrial base largely due to corruption [Source: [New World Encyclopedia](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Syngman_Rhee)]

**Nominally Democratic, Actually Corrupt**:
- Nominally democratic with opposition parties and elections
- Rhee and Liberal Party used bribery, electoral manipulation, and strong-arm tactics
- Economic system served regime maintenance rather than development

### Poverty and Stagnation

**Living Conditions**:
- Per capita income lower than Haiti, Ethiopia, and Yemen
- Over 40% of population in absolute poverty
- People scavenged for grass and bark to survive
- Many had growth stunted by malnutrition
- Life expectancy little more than 50 years [Source: [Association for Asian Studies](https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/an-unpromising-recovery-south-koreas-post-korean-war-economic-development-1953-1961/)]

**Economic Indicators**:
- Slow growth: only about 4% annually (under 2% per capita given high birthrates)
- Heavy inflation
- By 1956, Americans aware North Korea recovering much faster
- 1957: US began cutting aid, pressuring Rhee to reform
- Measures weakened regime but did not result in economic improvements

**Contrast with Later Development**:
- Rhee's economic failure stands in stark contrast to rapid development under Park Chung-hee (1961-1979)
- Same country, same culture, different leadership and policies
- Demonstrates that US aid alone could not produce development without effective governance

## The April Revolution (1960)

### The Fraudulent March 1960 Election

**Election Context**:
- March 15, 1960: Presidential and vice-presidential elections
- 84-year-old Rhee seeking fourth term
- Main opposition candidate Cho Byeong-ok died shortly before election
- Rhee won with claimed 88.7-100% of vote (versus 55% in 1956) [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1960_South_Korean_presidential_election)]

**Electoral Fraud**:
- Implausible result due to massive fraud
- Liberal Party stuffed ballots, switched ballots, removed opposition ballots
- Focus shifted to vice-presidential contest: Lee Ki-poong (Liberal) vs. Chang Myon (opposition)
- Elections heavily rigged in Lee Ki-poong's favor [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Revolution)]

### The Masan Incident

**March 15 Protests**:
- Protests erupted in Masan against election fraud
- High school student Kim Ju-yul disappeared during rioting

**Discovery of Body (April 11)**:
- Fisherman discovered Kim Ju-yul's corpse in Masan harbor
- Authorities claimed autopsy confirmed drowning
- Protesters forced their way into hospital
- Found Kim's skull had been split by 20-centimeter tear-gas grenade
- Grenade had penetrated from his eyes to back of his head [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Revolution)]

**Media Coverage**:
- Rhee regime tried to censor the story
- Korean press reported it with photo of Kim's body
- AP delivered story to the world
- Incident shocked nation and became basis of national movement

### "Bloody Tuesday" (April 19, 1960)

**Escalation**:
- April 18: Protests spread to Seoul; Korea University students launched non-violent protest
- Students attacked by gangs funded by Rhee supporters on return to campus

**The April 19 Protests**:
- Approximately 30,000 students from universities spontaneously assembled
- Marched toward central Seoul
- By midday, civilians joined, swelling crowds to over 100,000
- Total of 186 people killed during two weeks of protest [Source: [Library of Congress](https://guides.loc.gov/south-korean-democratization-movement/april-19-revolution)]

### US Withdrawal of Support

**Turning Point**:
- Government's brutal response fueled the flames
- United States, key ally, withdrew support for Rhee
- US government joined unanimous National Assembly vote demanding resignation [Source: [Swarthmore Global Nonviolent Action Database](https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/south-korean-students-force-dictator-resign-new-elections-1960)]

**Military Refusal**:
- April 25: 300 university professors joined protest, led demonstration at National Assembly
- Read list of demands, most important: resignation of President Rhee
- Martial Law Command under General Song Yo Chan refused to fire on demonstrators
- Military turned its back on Rhee regime [Source: [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/arts/languages-literatures-cultures-linguistics/korean-studies-research-hub/research/on-this-day-in-korean-history/7-4.19-the-april-revolution)]

### Rhee's Resignation (April 26, 1960)

**The End**:
- April 26, 1960: Rhee issued formal resignation
- Lee Ki-poong blamed for most of government corruption
- April 28: Lee Ki-poong's family committed suicide/murder
- Rhee spent month at Ihwajang residence [Source: [ADST](https://adst.org/2013/04/the-fall-of-south-korean-strongman-syngman-rhee-april-26-1960/)]

**Causes of Downfall**:
- Corruption in government
- Election rigging
- Police violence
- Emphasis on foreign affairs at expense of economic development
- Combined to create popular outrage even the aging Rhee could not suppress [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngman_Rhee)]

**Aftermath**:
- First Republic replaced by Second Republic
- New constitution adopted parliamentary system to remove power from presidency
- July 1960: Democratic Party's Yun Po-sun elected president; Chang Myon became Prime Minister
- Short-lived democracy overthrown by Park Chung-hee's military coup (May 16, 1961)

---

## Exile and Death

### Exile in Hawaii

**Departure**:
- May 29, 1960: Rhee departed for exile in Hawaii by plane
- Flown out of South Korea by the CIA
- Former president, his wife Francesca Donner, and adopted son lived in Honolulu [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngman_Rhee)]

**Life in Exile**:
- Rhee claimed he was "never in exile" - simply unable to return to homeland
- Spent final years in Honolulu, the city where he had advocated for Korean independence for 30 years before WWII

### Death (July 19, 1965)

- Died of stroke complications in Honolulu
- Week later, body returned to Seoul
- Buried in Seoul National Cemetery [Source: [Find a Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8411924/syngman-rhee)]

### Contested Legacy

**Conservative View**:
- Patriarch of the nation

**Recent Developments**:
- Ihwajang (Rhee's former residence) used as presidential memorial museum

## Scholarly Debates

### Cold War Origins of Authoritarianism

**Orthodox View**:
- Authoritarianism was unfortunate but necessary response to communist threat
- North Korean aggression and infiltration justified security measures
- US support for authoritarian allies prevented communist expansion

**Revisionist View (Bruce Cumings and others)**:
- US contributed to escalating conflict by supporting authoritarian regime
- American occupation officials followed Japanese colonial model
- Relied on former Japanese collaborators
- Neglected Korean nationalism and internal divisions
- Korean War was civil war internationalized by American involvement [Source: [University of New Hampshire](https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1884&context=honors)]

**Anti-Communism as Hegemonic Ideology**:
- Anti-communism played tremendous role in Korean politics
- Used to justify authoritarian repression of political dissidents
- Hindered development of party politics based on social cleavages
- Military regimes used National Security Law to block political critiques
- Excluded socialist parties from political arena entirely [Source: [SpringerOpen](https://ajges.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40856-017-0015-4)]

**Institutionalization**:
- Anti-communism concentrated in National Security Law
- Practiced by intelligence agencies: CIC, KCIA, special police units
- Equated with national identity and basic doctrine of state
- Remained animating force among South Korean conservatives [Source: [SpringerOpen](https://ajges.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40856-017-0014-5)]

### Transitional Justice

**Truth and Reconciliation Commission**:
- South Korea launched various transitional justice measures since democratization (1987)
- At least ten truth commissions established - leader in Asia Pacific region
- 2005 TRC investigated human rights violations from 1910-1987
- Operated December 2005 to December 2010
- Second term TRC set up in 2021 [Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Korea))]

**Findings on Bodo League**:
- TRC determined government participated in murders of over 200,000 civilians
- Documented testimonies from survivors and former executioners
- Government had concealed massacre for four decades [Source: [Hawaii Law Review](http://manoa.hawaii.edu/aplpj/wp-content/uploads/sites/120/2021/05/APLPJ_22.2_Aileen_Kim.pdf)]

**Findings on Jeju 4.3**:
- 2003: President Roh Moo-hyun apologized - first head of state apology for state violence
- 2019: Police and defense ministry apologized
- Victims receiving individual reparations and trauma treatment [Source: [MEI](https://www.mei.edu/publications/truth-commissions-south-korea-lessons-learned)]

**Ongoing Challenges**:
- Appetite to address past abuses remains strong among left-wing politicians
- Recent shift to addressing transitional justice in courtrooms
- Plaintiffs successfully seeking compensation for torture, kidnapping, Vietnam War atrocities
- Political polarization continues to affect how history is remembered [Source: [The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2024/05/transitional-justice-in-south-korea-a-turn-to-the-courts/)]

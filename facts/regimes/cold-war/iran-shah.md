## Scholarly Debate

### Key Interpretive Frameworks

#### Instrumentalist Thesis (Gasiorowski)
- SAVAK as Cold War construct
- Security apparatus as extension of American foreign policy
- Emphasizes external factors in regime's character

#### Social History Approach (Abrahamian)
- Focuses on lived experience of repression
- SAVAK as "bureaucracy of violence"
- Normalizing terror within administrative framework
- Classic works: *Iran Between Two Revolutions*, *Tortured Confessions*

#### Symptomatic Interpretation (Keddie)
- SAVAK as symptom of regime's political weakness
- Repression reflecting fundamental illegitimacy
- Classic work: *Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution*

### Central Debates

#### Modernization vs. Repression
- Was White Revolution genuine reform or elite preservation?
- Did rapid modernization inevitably require authoritarian control?
- Could slower, more democratic development have succeeded?

#### The Repression Paradox
- Human rights campaigners: Shah's error was excessive repression
- Some historians (e.g., Hafezi): Shah was "too weak, slow and irresolute in repression"
- Debate over whether more or less force could have saved regime

#### Causes of Revolution
- Conservative backlash against Westernization/secularization?
- Popular reaction to social injustice?
- Role of clergy vs. secular opposition?
- Importance of economic factors vs. ideology?

#### Legacy Reassessment
- Post-2022 "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement: nostalgia for Pahlavi era
- Social media trends invoking Reza Shah as symbol of progress
- Reflects dissatisfaction with Islamic Republic
- Complicated by regime's human rights record

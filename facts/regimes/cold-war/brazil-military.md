## Pre-Conditions

### Joao Goulart's Government (1961-1964)

**Accession to Power**:
Democratically elected vice president in 1960, Joao Goulart (known as "Jango") assumed power after President Janio Quadros resigned in August 1961. The military vehemently opposed Goulart's inauguration; only after Congress created a quasi-parliamentary system stripping presidential powers was he allowed to take office. In January 1963, a national plebiscite restored his full presidential powers.

**Basic Reforms (Reformas de Base)**:
Goulart's progressive agenda included:
- **Agrarian reform**: Redistribution of large non-productive agricultural properties
- **Labor protections**: Extension of labor rights to rural workers
- **Education**: Application of 15% of national income to educational programs
- **Nationalism**: Limitations on profit remittances by multinational corporations; natural resource sovereignty
- **Voting rights**: Extension of suffrage to illiterate citizens and low-ranking military officers

### Economic Crisis

From the time Goulart took office in 1961, Brazil faced severe economic challenges:
- **Rising inflation**: Annual rate approached 100% by early 1964
- **Balance of payments deficit**: Foreign accounts in crisis
- **Difficulty attracting foreign capital**: Investor flight
- **Failed stabilization**: Finance Minister Celso Furtado's three-year plan had little effect as government was reluctant to sacrifice growth for stability
- **IMF negotiations**: Abandoned efforts to formulate austerity plan
- **External debt crisis**: Unresolved

### Political Polarization

**Conservative Opposition**:
- Stabilization opposed by bankers and industrialists who benefited from inflation
- Rural property interests in Congress rejected agrarian reform as "an outrageous assault" on land ownership
- Catholic Church initially supported coup
- Anti-communist civilian movements among middle and upper classes

**March 13, 1964 Rally**:
Goulart participated in a rally at Rio's Central do Brasil before 150,000 people, announcing leftist measures by presidential decree including nationalization of foreign oil refineries and seizure of agricultural land. The military-conservative bloc labeled it a "socialist threat" intended to "Bolshevize" Brazil.

### U.S. Concerns and Cold War Context

The Kennedy and Johnson administrations viewed Goulart's progressive reforms with alarm:
- Policies labeled as communist by critics
- Fear of "another Cuba" in Latin America
- U.S. ambassador Lincoln Gordon advocated intervention
- CIA monitored military conspiracies for over two years before coup
- By 1963, CIA was actively looking for a military group to support

---

## Rise to Power

### The March 31 - April 1, 1964 Coup

**Planning and Execution**:
The military coup was planned and executed by the seniormost commanders of the Brazilian Army, supported by almost all high-ranking military members, along with conservative sectors including the Catholic Church and anti-communist civilian movements.

**Timeline**:
- **March 31, 1964**: Military units began moving against Goulart government
- **April 1, 1964**: Coup completed; Goulart fled to Uruguay
- **April 11, 1964**: Congress elected Castello Branco as president

**Goulart's Fate**:
Rather than resist and risk civil war, Goulart fled to Uruguay, then Argentina, where he died in 1976 under suspicious circumstances (widely believed poisoned through Operation Condor).

### Operation Brother Sam (U.S. Support)

**Planning**:
With deteriorating relations with Goulart's government, U.S. officials planned contingency support for the opposition. The issue was discussed between U.S. Ambassador Lincoln Gordon and Washington officials throughout the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.

**Authorization**:
President Lyndon B. Johnson was briefed on the ongoing coup and "greenlit measures to take every step" to support the opposition if needed. A White House meeting on March 20 established that an aircraft carrier and tankers would be sent to support the insurgents.

**Military Assets Deployed**:
The operation was activated to transfer fuel and supplies:
- **Naval component**: Aircraft carrier USS Forrestal, helicopter carrier, six destroyers from Second Fleet, four tankers
- **Air component**: Seven C-135 aircraft, eight supply aircraft, one air support/rescue aircraft, eight fighters, communications plane, airborne command post, weapons and ammunition
- Air Force General George S. Brown commanded the mission, coordinated by Southern Command in Panama

**Outcome**:
The opposition military in Brazil quickly overthrew Goulart, and Castello Branco reported that logistical support would not be needed. Ships were to arrive April 10, but with the cancellation, they returned to port. U.S. intervention was prepared but ultimately unnecessary.

**Discovery**:
The operation came to light through historian Phyllis R. Parker, who accessed newly released documents at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library as part of her master's program begun in 1974.

## Methods of Control

### Institutional Acts (Atos Institucionais)

The regime enacted 17 major Institutional Acts granting unchecked power to dissolve political parties, censor media, and arrest dissenters.

**AI-2 (October 1965)**:
- Abolished existing political parties
- Instituted two-party system: ARENA (government) and MDB (controlled opposition)
- Expanded military jurisdiction

**AI-5 — Institutional Act Number Five (December 13, 1968)**:

The most repressive decree, signed by President Costa e Silva:

**Trigger**: Representative Marcio Moreira Alves spoke against the military invasion of the University of Brasilia. When the lower house refused to expel Alves on December 11, AI-5 was signed two days later.

**Powers Granted**:
- Suspended habeas corpus for "crimes of political motivation"
- Allowed president to order Congress, state legislatures, and municipal councils into forced recess
- Enabled removal of opposition politicians from office
- Permitted federal intervention in states and municipalities
- Legalized prior censorship of press, music, film, theater, and television
- Political meetings required police authorization
- Political rights could be stripped for up to ten years
- Institutionalized arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killing

**Immediate Actions**:
Costa e Silva closed the National Congress and all state legislatures (except Sao Paulo) for almost a year. Mass arrests and cassations targeted approximately 4,000 politicians and intellectuals.

**Duration**: December 13, 1968 to October 13, 1978 (repealed under Geisel's opening process)

### DOI-CODI — Torture and Intelligence Apparatus

**Origins**:
- **OBAN (Operacao Bandeirante)** created in 1969 during the harshest period of repression, coordinating military agencies against leftist groups
- **DOI-CODI** emerged in September 1970 as "institutionalization" of OBAN

**Structure**:
- **DOI (Detachment of Information Operations)**: Responsible for searching, apprehending, and interrogating suspects
- **CODI (Center for Internal Defense Operations)**: Analyzed information, coordinated agencies, strategic planning
- Created through secret guidelines approved by President Medici, not law or decree
- Reported directly to the Army

**Locations**:
- **Sao Paulo (Rua Tutoia)**: Largest DOI-CODI with nearly 250 agents at peak; nicknamed "Tutoia Hilton" (after Hanoi Hilton) for extensive torture in its basement
- **Rio de Janeiro (Rua Barao de Mesquita 425)**: Operated in barracks of 1st Army Police Battalion
- **Nine other capital cities** developed DOI-CODI headquarters during the 1970s

**Methods**:
DOI-CODI was responsible for suppressing internal dissent, acting as political police using torture and counter-insurgency methods with anti-communist focus.

**Notable Case — Vladimir Herzog**:
Journalist Vladimir Herzog was tortured and murdered inside the Sao Paulo DOI-CODI building in 1975. The military staged photographs to simulate suicide. His death is considered a turning point in Brazil's redemocratization.

**Foreign Influence**:
- Inspiration came from French experience in Algerian War (interrogation and torture methods)
- U.S. experience via National Security Doctrine
- CIA support through military experts
- School of the Americas identified as center for disseminating torture techniques

**Conviction**:
In 2006, Colonel Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, former head of Sao Paulo DOI-CODI, was tried for torture in military court.

### Censorship

**Development**:
- Initially (1964-1968): Confiscation with physical coercion at random checkpoints
- After AI-5 (1968): Systematic control over all publishing
- **DCDP (Divisao de Censura de Diversoes Publicas)**: Created June 2, 1972 under Federal Police to centralize censorship

**Scope**:
- Control over newspapers, radio, television, cinema, literary fiction
- Prior censorship before publication
- Shows, plays, and cultural events required vetting
- Censors became permanent fixtures in newsrooms
- Pro-dictatorship publications encouraged through government subsidies

**Impact on Media**:
- Mainstream media initially cooperated with coup, later opposed and fell under heavy censorship
- Military invaded newspapers and occupied radio/TV stations
- Blocked Post Office telex and censored telephone lines

**Artist Persecution**:
- Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil arrested December 27, 1968 (days after AI-5)
- Many Brazilian artists lived in exile
- Some artists disguised subversive messages in work
- Newspapers printed excerpts from 16th-century poetry or absurd recipes (e.g., "1 kilogram of salt") to indicate censored content

**End**:
- Abertura (1979): Prior censorship suspended
- March 1985: All constraints on political speech removed
- 1988 Constitution: Virtually all media control banned

## Key Events & Atrocities

### Years of Lead (Anos de Chumbo) — 1968-1974

The most repressive period of the dictatorship occurred during the Medici presidency:
- Represented state violence against dissidents at its peak
- AI-5 installed what survivors called a "terrorist state"
- Increased practice of torture, deaths, executions, and disappearances
- Urban guerrilla movements emerged in response, met with violent suppression

### Death Squads (Esquadrao da Morte)

**Origins**:
Death squads began receiving widespread publicity in 1968 during extreme political unrest. The military had joined civilian police in enforcing the suspension of constitutional guarantees.

**Government Role**:
In the late 1960s, the military government gave covert approval for death squads against real or suspected opponents.

**Victims**:
Included intellectuals, students, journalists, workers, priests and nuns, and common criminals labeled "third-class marginals."

### Torture Methods Documented

According to survivor testimony and the National Truth Commission:
- **Electric shock**: Applied to genitals and sensitive areas
- **Beatings**: Systematic physical assault
- **Pau de Arara**: Hanging from pole behind bent knees
- **Waterboarding**: Near-drowning
- **Sexual violence**: Rape and sexual humiliation
- **Dragging**: Bodies tied to jeeps and trucks
- **Psychological torture**: Mock executions, threats to family members

**Case of Stuart Angel Jones**:
Young economics student and MR-8 guerrilla militant arrested by Air Force intelligence in June 1971. At Galeao Air Force Base, military doctors tied him to a jeep and repeatedly crushed his shins; then he was dragged around the courtyard by a truck. He died under torture; the official report claimed he "escaped." His mother Zuzu Angel became a vocal critic and died in a suspicious car crash in 1976, widely believed orchestrated by the military.

### Araguaia Guerrilla War (1972-1974)

**Background**:
- Founded by militants of the Communist Party of Brazil (PC do B)
- Established rural stronghold in Araguaia River basin from 1966
- By 1972, over 60 PC do B activists had settled in the region
- Aimed to wage War of National Liberation against the dictatorship

**Military Response**:
- **Operacao Papagaio (Operation Parrot)** — April-October 1972: Large conventional military units; ineffective
- Napalm bombing of three areas confirmed by 2013 Truth Commission report
- **Operacao Sucuri (Operation Anaconda)** — April-October 1973: Intelligence operation using guerrilla warfare methods and infiltration

**Casualties**:
- Approximately 80 guerrillas in movement
- Fewer than 20 survived
- 67 killed in the Araguaia front according to OAB Commission
- 60 combatants still officially listed as "disappeared"

**Cover-up (1975)**:
With guerrilla wiped out, military began concealment operation under President Geisel's orders:
- Absolute secrecy policy
- Documents burned
- Camps dismantled
- Bodies exhumed, burned, and re-hidden

**Legal Aftermath**:
In December 2010, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found Brazil guilty for forced disappearance of at least 70 peasants and militants, ruling Brazil's amnesty law "incompatible with the American Convention and void of any legal effects."

### Ambassador Kidnapping (1969)

On September 4, 1969, ALN (National Liberation Action) and MR-8 jointly kidnapped United States Ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick in Rio de Janeiro, demanding the release of 15 political prisoners. The prisoners were freed and flown to Mexico.

### Death Toll — Scholarly Estimates

**Official Findings**:
- **OAB Commission (1964-1981)**: 333 killed, including 67 at Araguaia
- **National Truth Commission (2014)**: Over 400 identified; 191 killed, 243 "disappeared"
- **General estimates**: 434+ killed or forcibly disappeared

**Torture**:
- 20,000-50,000 people tortured (estimates vary)
- Thousands underwent police interrogation

**Military Casualties**:
According to Brazilian Army: 97 military and civilians killed by leftist guerrilla actions

## Economic Policies

### The "Brazilian Miracle" (1968-1973)

**Overview**:
Period of exceptional economic growth during the military dictatorship, achieved via heterodox developmentalist model.

**Key Figures**:
- **Antonio Delfim Netto**: Finance Minister; main architect of economic policies
- Achieved primarily during Medici presidency (1969-1974)

- Inflation maintained between 15-20% per year

**Policy Measures**:
- Diversification of exports
- Encouragement of foreign investment
- Tax incentives and currency devaluations
- Joint ventures with multinationals (Volkswagen, Ford) receiving fiscal incentives for local assembly and technology transfer

### Costs and Consequences

**Income Inequality**:
- GINI coefficient rose from approximately 0.50 (early 1960s) to 0.57 (1970)
- Real minimum wage dropped 15% between 1967 and 1973
- Benefits concentrated among capitalists and higher-income social classes
- Growth advantages not evenly distributed

**Debt Accumulation**:
- External debt quadrupled 1964-1973: from $3.1 billion to $12.5 billion
- By 1985 (end of regime): External debt reached $96 billion

**Oil Crisis Impact (1973)**:
- OPEC price increases hit Brazil hard
- Oil spending increased external debt
- Economy weakened; gradual decline after 1974
- 1980s became the "lost decade"

**Simultaneous Realities**:
Historian Elio Gaspari observed that the "Miracle" and the "Years of Lead" were simultaneous realities that each side denied: "Both were real, coexisting while denying each other."

## Fall / End

### Geisel's Distensao (1974-1979)

**Political Opening Begins**:
President Ernesto Geisel began liberalization in 1974, allowing the MDB opposition party greater participation in congressional elections. His programs were labeled "abertura" (opening) and "distensao" (decompression).

**Reforms**:
- Addressed some human rights violations
- Began dismantling Institutional Acts (1978)
- Repealed AI-5 in October 1978
- Despite opening, authoritarian practices like torture continued

**Opposition Emergence**:
- Christian and Catholic anti-military organizations formed
- Small feminist movement emerged
- Militant African-Brazilian groups organized
- Rise in militant trade unionists across industries
- Large strikes in late 1970s
- Workers' Party created with Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as leader

### Figueiredo's Abertura (1979-1985)

**Key Actions**:
- Freed last political prisoners (1980)
- Instituted direct elections for governors (1982)
- Allowed opposition parties to organize
- Permitted dissidents to return from exile

**Amnesty Law (August 28, 1979)**:
Amnestied those convicted of "political" crimes between 1961-1978. While allowing political prisoners and exiles to return, it also pardoned the murderers, torturers, and leaders of the dictatorship.

### Diretas Ja Movement (1983-1984)

**Background**:
Civil movement demanding direct presidential elections, bringing together political parties, trade unions, civil society, students, and journalists.

**Constitutional Amendment**:
Deputy Dante de Oliveira proposed amendment to revoke the military's indirect election system.

**Mass Demonstrations**:
- **April 16, 1984**: Final demonstration in Sao Paulo's Anhangabau Valley — over 1.5 million people (largest political demonstration in Brazilian history)
- **Days before**: One million attended Candelaria demonstration in Rio de Janeiro

**Key Leaders**:
Politicians: Ulysses Guimaraes, Tancredo Neves, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Mario Covas, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Leonel Brizola
Artists: Milton Nascimento, Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque de Holanda, Fernanda Montenegro

**Defeat**:
Despite 298 votes in favor (65 against), 112 pro-government deputies abstained, leaving the Chamber without quorum. The bill died on April 26, 1984, short of 22 votes.

### Transition to Civilian Rule (1985)

**Indirect Election**:
Despite the amendment's failure, opposition forces secured their candidate. Tancredo Neves was elected president by the electoral college with 480 votes (73%) against 180 for the government candidate.

**Tragic Turn**:
Neves became seriously ill before inauguration, hospitalized with intestinal infection. After 38 days and seven operations, he died without taking office on April 21, 1985.

**Jose Sarney**:
Vice President Jose Sarney, a long-time supporter of the military regime who had defected to the opposition, was confirmed as first civilian president since 1964.

**Formal End**:
March 15, 1985 marked the formal end of military rule with the inauguration of civilian leadership.

---

## Aftermath

### 1988 Constitution

The transition culminated in the "Citizen Constitution" of 1988:
- Expanded civil liberties and voting rights
- Abolished literacy requirements for suffrage
- Provided protections for political rights
- Banned virtually all forms of media control

### Impunity and the Amnesty Law

**Continued Protection**:
- 1979 Amnesty Law continues protecting military perpetrators
- No individual has been punished for human rights violations
- Unlike Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay, Brazil conducted no punitive processes

**Legal Challenges**:
- **April 2010**: Brazilian Supreme Court refused to revoke Amnesty Law
- **December 2010**: Inter-American Court of Human Rights condemned the law
- **2016**: Supreme Court narrowly upheld amnesty
- Debates continue to present day

### National Truth Commission (2012-2014)

**Establishment**:
Created in 2011 under President Dilma Rousseff (herself a former political prisoner) to investigate human rights violations 1946-1988.

**Structure**:
- Seven members supported by over 200 research staff
- Investigation lasted 2 years, 7 months (May 2012 - December 2014)
- Final report: 4,400 pages in three volumes

**Key Findings**:
- Military dictatorship was responsible for crimes against humanity
- State apparatus of repression existed as policy at highest levels
- 377 perpetrators denounced as responsible for implementing state terror
- Detailed Operation Condor cooperation between Southern Cone dictatorships
- Documented U.S. training of Brazilian military in torture techniques
- Gross human rights violations continue in Brazil due to lack of security force reform

**Recommendations**:
29 recommendations including:
- Accountability of perpetrators
- Reparation and memory policies
- Review of 1979 Amnesty Law

**Limitations**:
- No power to prosecute
- Amnesty Law remained in force
- Some state agents refused to cooperate

### Scholarly Debate

**Too Little, Too Late?**:
Scholar Nina Schneider questioned whether the Commission came "too little too late" or was "premature," examining "best timing" in transitional justice.

**Incomplete Transition**:
Scholars observe significant gaps between Brazil's past and present over 30 years into redemocratization. Political transition occurred under military tutelage with no visible break from the past, making it difficult to establish deep transformations.

**Depoliticization Critique**:
Some scholars argue that while the CNV denounced perpetrators, it also created a depoliticized idea of leftist militants as mere "dreamers who fought for liberty and democracy" rather than acknowledging their revolutionary political aims.

### Continuing Legacy

**Cultural Amnesia**:
Victims have never garnered much sympathy or acknowledgement in Brazilian society.

**Political Polarization**:
Brazil's return to democracy was slow and incomplete. The military regime was never fully reckoned with:
- Legal cover-ups still block many trials
- Myth of "order" still resonates in polarized society
- Challenging military crimes portrayed as "leftist" cause

**Contemporary Relevance**:
As of 2025, debates over amnesty continue. The film "I'm Still Here" showcases human impacts of the dictatorship. According to activists, Brazil's failure to institutionalize recognition of military crimes creates precedent for impunity.

---

## Scholarly Debate

### Causes of the Coup

**Cold War Context**:
- Alignment with U.S. anti-communist agenda
- Fear of "another Cuba"
- National Security Doctrine influence

**Domestic Factors**:
- Economic crisis and inflation
- Conservative elite opposition to reforms
- Military institutional interests
- Middle and upper class anti-communist sentiment

**U.S. Role Debate**:
- Some scholars argue U.S. directly orchestrated coup
- Others contend U.S. "created conditions" but coup was "Made in Brazil"
- Recent declassified documents show U.S. joined conspiracy in 1963, not earlier

### Characterizing the Regime

**"Bureaucratic-Authoritarianism"**:
Political scientist Guillermo O'Donnell's model: technocratic military rule with rotating leadership, distinct from personalist dictatorships.

**Factions**:
- **"Sorbonnists"** (Castello Branco, Geisel): Moderate faction; favored eventual return to democracy
- **"Hard-liners"** (Costa e Silva, Medici): Favored indefinite suspension of democratic processes; more nationalistic

### Economic "Miracle" Assessment

**Pro-"Miracle" Arguments**:
- Exceptional GDP growth (averaging over 10%)
- Industrialization and modernization
- Infrastructure development
- Controlled inflation

**Critical Arguments**:
- Growth benefited wealthy disproportionately
- Real wages for workers declined
- Inequality worsened significantly
- External debt ballooned
- Growth unsustainable after oil crisis
- "Lost decade" of 1980s followed

### Transitional Justice Model

**Brazil's Approach**:
- Truth commission over criminal trials
- Reparations to victims
- No prosecutions due to amnesty law
- "Pacted transition" negotiated with military

**Comparative Assessment**:
- Unlike neighbors (Argentina, Chile), no "Nunca Mas" trials
- Amnesty Law remains in force
- Military never formally acknowledged crimes
- Scholars debate whether stability was purchased at cost of justice

- [[argentina-junta]] — relationship: temporal (Operation Condor partner; similar methods)
- [[indonesia-suharto]] — relationship: thematic (Cold War anti-communist dictatorship; U.S. support; "miracle" economic narrative)
- [[spain-franco]] — relationship: thematic (long-duration authoritarian regime; gradual transition)

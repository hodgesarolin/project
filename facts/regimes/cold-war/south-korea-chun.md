## Pre-Conditions

### The Assassination of Park Chung-hee (October 26, 1979)

On October 26, 1979, President Park Chung-hee was assassinated by Kim Jae-gyu, the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), at a private dinner in Seoul. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Park_Chung_Hee)

**Background to the Assassination**:
- **Bu-Ma Uprising**: Mass pro-democracy protests erupted in Busan and Masan in October 1979, the largest since the 1960 April Revolution

## Scholarly Debates

### Developmental Authoritarianism

**The "Developmental Dictatorship" Concept**:
A developmental dictatorship refers to "a system used to justify a dictatorship that restricts the people's participation in politics based on the reason that political security is a prerequisite to economic growth." [Source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/saje.12391)

**Core Debate**:
Scholars have extensively debated the relationship between South Korea's economic development and authoritarianism:
- To what extent did economic growth occur *because of* political oppression?
- Could development have occurred under democratic governance?
- Does economic success justify authoritarian methods? [Source](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/86224/9780472904037.pdf)

**Comparative Context**:
Historical examples of developmental dictatorships include:
- South Korea under [[south-korea-park|Park Chung-hee]] and Chun Doo-hwan
- [[taiwan-chiang|Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek]]
- Singapore under Lee Kuan Yew
- [[philippines-marcos|Philippines under Ferdinand Marcos]] (though less economically successful) [Source](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/event/dictator-s-modernity-dilemma-development-and-democracy-south-korea-1961-1987)

### The "Double-Edged Sword" Thesis

**Seeds of Mobilization Argument**:
Recent scholarship argues that modernization acted as a "double-edged sword":

**Initial Stabilization**:
- Industrial complexes and higher education initially increased regime support
- Economic performance provided performance-based legitimacy
- Mass media expansion promoted state loyalty [Source](https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/5425kd22s)

**Long-term Destabilization**:
- Same structures (factories, universities) became mobilizing sites for opposition
- Workers and students developed organizational capacity
- Economic development created middle class that eventually demanded political rights
- Korea's advance to democracy was not linear [Source](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/86224/9780472904037.pdf)

### Democratic Transition Theories

**Multiple Factors**:
Korea's democratization resulted from combination of:
- Pressure from below (students, workers, churches)
- Pressure from above (Olympic deadline, international attention)
- Split within regime (Roh's calculation to accept democracy)
- Structural changes from economic development [Source](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/07/contested-politics-south-korea/2-south-koreas-democratic-evolution)

**Phases of Political Evolution**:
Scholars identify five phases in South Korea's post-1945 politics:
1. "Illiberal democracy" (1945-1960)
2. "Democratic authoritarianism" (1961-1972)
3. "Authoritarian exceptionalism" (1972-1987)
4. "Democratic paternalism" (1987-2001)
5. "Participatory democracy" (2002-present) [Source](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/07/contested-politics-south-korea/2-south-koreas-democratic-evolution)

### Consolidation vs. Transition

**Distinct Challenges**:
- Transition: Well-defined tasks (free elections, new constitution)
- Consolidation: Multiple challenges (corruption, past crimes, institutional weakness)
- Conditions favoring transition do not necessarily promote consolidation [Source](https://www.routledge.com/From-Transition-to-Power-Alternation-Democracy-in-South-Korea-1987-1997/Saxer/p/book/9780415864923)

**Korean Case**:
- 1992: First civilian president (Kim Young-sam)
- 1997: First opposition victory (Kim Dae-jung)
- Late 1990s: Still not fully consolidated democracy
- 1996-1997 trials of Chun and Roh represented transitional justice [Source](https://www.hoover.org/research/rough-road-democracy)

### Labor and Cold War Context

**Structural Foundation**:
- South Korea's "miracle growth" built on Cold War developmental state
- Founded on repression and subjugation of labor
- Cheap, politically subordinated workers enabled catch-up industrialization
- Government-chaebol alliance prioritized export growth over workers' rights [Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00472336.2025.2499566)

## Ethiopian Famine (1983-1985)

### Causes
- Severe drought affecting Gojjam, Hararghe, Tigray, and Wollo provinces
- Record low rainfall in mid-1980s
- Ongoing Ethiopian Civil War disrupted agriculture and food distribution
- Counterinsurgency policies deliberately targeted food security
- Military spending consumed 46% of GNP (1984); health budget fell from 6% to 3%
- Forced resettlement and villagization disrupted rural communities
- Government policies weaponized hunger against rebel regions

### Scale and Death Toll
- Approximately 8 million people became famine victims
- Death toll estimates: 400,000-1,000,000
  - UN estimate of 1 million widely cited but challenged
  - Famine scholar Alex de Waal: 400,000-500,000 deaths
  - Called UN figure "remarkably cavalier" with "absolutely no scientific basis"
- Human Rights Watch: More than half of mortality attributable to "human rights abuses causing the famine to come earlier, strike harder and extend further"

### International Response
- **October 23, 1984**: BBC's Michael Buerk broadcast from Korem
  - Described "a biblical famine in the 20th century" and "the closest thing to hell on Earth"
  - Footage shot by cameraman Mohamed Amin
  - Broadcast by 425 television stations worldwide
  - Called "one of the most influential pieces of television ever broadcast"
- **Band Aid** (December 1984): Bob Geldof organized charity supergroup
  - "Do They Know It's Christmas?" raised 8 million pounds in first year
  - 40 years later, royalties have raised 200+ million pounds
- **Live Aid** (July 1985): Dual concerts in London and Philadelphia
  - 1.9 billion viewers worldwide (40% of world population)
  - Raised approximately 150 million pounds

### Controversy Over Aid
- Some journalists alleged Derg diverted aid to fund resettlement and military
- Debate continues over how much aid reached intended recipients
- Aid organizations faced difficult choices about cooperation with regime

---

## Forced Resettlement and Villagization

### Resettlement Program (1984-1986)
- Launched late 1984 in response to famine (or using famine as pretext)
- Official goal: relocate peasants from drought-affected north to fertile south/southwest
- Actually served as counterinsurgency strategy to depopulate rebel areas

#### Scale
- 1985-1986: approximately 600,000 people forcibly relocated
- By March 1986: 800,000 people moved
- Plans called for relocating 33-37 million people (entire rural population) by 1990s

#### Methods
- Military forced people from Korem and other camps into armed trucks
- Families separated; communities broken up
- People shot when resisting forced relocation
- Red Cross ration card distribution used as trap to capture people for resettlement

#### Death Toll
- **Human Rights Watch**: "Very roughly, a minimum of about 50,000 people killed"
  - Acknowledged as underestimate due to methodology limitations
- **Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)**: At least 100,000 died in 1985 alone during operations
- **Upper estimates**: 50,000-100,000 deaths from resettlement operations

### Villagization Program (1985-1989)
- Separate from resettlement; grouped scattered farmers into village clusters
- Official goals: rational land use, resource conservation, improve access to services

#### Scale
- By March 1986: 4.6 million people relocated into 4,500+ villages (Shewa, Arsi, Hararghe)
- By 1989: approximately 13 million people villagized

#### Failure
- International criticism mounted
- Deteriorating security conditions
- Lack of resources for promised services
- Program abandoned as regime collapsed

- **February 18, 1975**: Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) founded in Dedebit, Tigray
- Founded by seven students
- Inspired by suppression of 1943 Tigrayan revolt (First Woyane)
- Driven by Marxist-Leninist ideology and Tigrayan nationalism

### Early Struggles
- First three years marked by struggle for survival
- Unstable cooperation with Eritrean forces
- Power struggles against other Tigrayan fronts
- Heavy losses from Derg offensives
- EPLF provided crucial training and equipment

### Military Campaign
- TPLF fought 15-year war against Derg (1975-1991)
- Conflict aggravated 1984-1985 famine
- By late 1980s, TPLF defeated Derg forces in multiple engagements

### Derg-Soviet Alliance
- 1976: Derg declared Ethiopia "socialist," broke relations with Washington
- May 1977: Secret Soviet-Ethiopian military agreement signed
- USSR provided massive support during Ogaden War and after

### Scale of Soviet Support
- **1977-1985**: Over $10-11 billion in military aid
- Supplies included: 600 tanks, 80 aircraft, 300 armored personnel carriers

- November 1977: Somalia abrogated 1974 Treaty, suspended relations with Cuba
- Somalia turned to United States for support

### Cold War Significance
- Zbigniew Brzezinski: "SALT lies buried in the sands of the Ogaden"

## Scholarly Debate

### Historiographical Questions

#### Classification as Genocide
- Ethiopian penal code (1957) includes political groups in genocide definition
- International genocide convention excludes political groups
- Mengistu convicted under Ethiopian law's broader definition
- Debate continues over appropriate legal and historical classification

#### Death Toll Controversies
- Wide range of estimates (500,000 to 2,000,000) reflects methodology challenges
- Alex de Waal criticized UN's "cavalier" approach to famine statistics
- Difficulty distinguishing famine deaths from conflict deaths
- Red Terror estimates range from 10,000 to 980,000
- Most scholars accept 100,000-500,000 total Red Terror deaths

### Interpretive Debates

#### Revolutionary Violence vs. State Terror
- Derg invoked "red terror" to legitimize violence against "counter-revolutionaries"
- Concept contested and used for divergent political projects
- Question of whether violence was ideologically driven or power consolidation

#### Role of Ideology
- Genuine Marxist-Leninist project or opportunistic power grab?
- Soviet model vs. indigenous Ethiopian dynamics
- Relationship between revolutionary goals and repressive methods

#### Famine Causation
- "War and drought" as dominant explanation since 1991
- Human Rights Watch: human rights abuses made famine worse
- Debate over intentionality of famine as weapon
- Role of resettlement and villagization policies

### New Research Directions
- Scholars examining role of trade unions and kebeles in Red Terror
- New sources: labor union files, oral histories, East German Stasi archives
- Focus on synergies between diverse actors and structures
- Connections to wider debates about genocide, imperialism, modernity, and war
- Integration of Ethiopian historiography with genocide studies

### Transitional Justice Assessment
- Red Terror trials partially succeeded in establishing accountability
- Prevented summary executions and revenge killings
- Elicited some historical truths
- Criticisms:
  - Narrow focus on criminal prosecutions
  - Limited truth and reconciliation elements
  - Questioned legitimacy amid EPRDF's own human rights violations
  - Lengthy proceedings (12 years for main trial)

## Confidence Assessment

| Category | Confidence Level | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| **Basic Facts** (dates, names, events) | HIGH | Well-documented in multiple sources |
| **Death Toll - Red Terror** | MEDIUM | Estimates range 10,000-500,000+; methodology varies |
| **Death Toll - Famine** | MEDIUM | UN estimate (1 million) challenged; 400,000-1,000,000 range |
| **Death Toll - Resettlement** | MEDIUM | 50,000-100,000 estimates from HRW, MSF |
| **Death Toll - Total Regime** | LOW-MEDIUM | 500,000-2,000,000 range reflects significant uncertainty |
| **Soviet/Cuban Support Details** | HIGH | Well-documented in Cold War literature |
| **Mengistu's Personal Responsibility** | HIGH | Established through trial, convictions, testimony |
| **Policy Motivations** | MEDIUM | Debate continues over ideology vs. power |
| **International Aid Diversion** | MEDIUM | Allegations documented but scale disputed |

### Key Uncertainties
1. Precise Red Terror death toll will likely never be established
2. Extent of intentionality in famine deaths remains debated
3. Full scope of Derg internal decision-making not fully documented
4. Some atrocities (especially in rural areas) under-documented
5. Mengistu's personal role in specific events (e.g., Haile Selassie's death) based largely on testimony

### Source Quality Notes
- Wikipedia articles generally well-sourced for this topic
- Human Rights Watch reports based on extensive fieldwork
- Academic sources provide critical analysis of mainstream narratives
- Ethiopian court records provide detailed but prosecution-oriented perspective
- Cold War-era sources from multiple sides help triangulate events

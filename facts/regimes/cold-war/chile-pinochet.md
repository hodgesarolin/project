## Pre-Conditions

### Salvador Allende's Socialist Government (1970-1973)
Salvador Allende was elected President of Chile on September 4, 1970, becoming the first Marxist to be democratically elected president in a liberal democracy in Latin America. His Unidad Popular (Popular Unity) coalition pursued socialist policies including:
- **Nationalization**: Copper mines, banks, key industries brought under state control
- **Agrarian reform**: Land redistribution to peasants
- **Wage increases**: Real wages for workers increased significantly
- **Social programs**: Expanded education, health, and housing

### Economic Crisis
By 1973, Chile faced severe economic instability:
- **Inflation**: Reached 605% by 1973
- **Shortages**: Consumer goods, food, and spare parts became scarce
- **Capital flight**: Business owners and wealthy Chileans moved assets abroad
- **U.S. economic pressure**: Nixon administration worked to "make the economy scream"
- **Strikes**: Truckers' strikes (partially CIA-funded) disrupted commerce

### Political Polarization
Chilean society became deeply divided:
- **Right-wing opposition**: National Party and segments of Christian Democrats opposed Allende
- **Paramilitary groups**: Patria y Libertad (Fatherland and Liberty) conducted violent actions
- **Left-wing radicalization**: MIR (Revolutionary Left Movement) pushed for faster, more radical change
- **Military unrest**: Growing tension between constitutionalist and interventionist factions in armed forces

### U.S. Involvement (Nixon, Kissinger, CIA)

**Pre-1970 Election**:
- The CIA spent $2.6 million on anti-Allende propaganda between 1963-1973
- In September 1970, Nixon told CIA director Richard Helms: "Make the economy scream"
- National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger stated: "I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people"

**Track I and Track II**:
- **Track I**: Prevent Allende's inauguration through "parliamentary trickery" and bribes
- **Track II**: Promote military coup; included funding for kidnapping General Rene Schneider (who was killed October 22, 1970) because he opposed military intervention

**Destabilization Campaign (1970-1973)**:
- $8 million spent on covert actions according to 1975 Church Committee Report
- CIA funded El Mercurio newspaper and opposition groups
- ITT Corporation served as conduit for funding opposition
- Economic sanctions contributed to Chile's economic crisis

## Rise to Power

### The September 11, 1973 Coup

**Timeline**:
- **6:00 AM**: Navy seized Valparaiso; military took control of ports
- **7:00 AM**: Armed forces issued ultimatum to Allende to resign
- **8:00 AM**: Army units surrounded La Moneda presidential palace
- **11:52 AM**: Hawker Hunter jets bombed La Moneda
- **2:00 PM**: Troops stormed the palace; Allende found dead (ruled suicide)

**Death of Salvador Allende**:
Allende's final radio address: "Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers! These are my last words, and I am certain that my sacrifice will not be in vain."
Forensic evidence from 2011 autopsy confirmed suicide by gunshot.

**Role of the Military**:
- Naval officers initiated coup planning; Pinochet was informed only three days before
- Pinochet was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army on August 23, 1973 by Allende himself
- Four-member junta formed: Pinochet (Army), Merino (Navy), Leigh (Air Force), Mendoza (Carabineros)
- Pinochet quickly consolidated personal control, becoming President in 1974

**U.S. Role**:
- CIA had intelligence collection relationships with some coup plotters
- A 2000 U.S. Intelligence Community report states CIA did not directly instigate the coup but was aware of plotting and "probably appeared to condone it"
- Declassified documents show Nixon and Kissinger were aware of military plans in the days before
- Kissinger later said they "created the conditions as great as possible" for the coup

## Methods of Control

### DINA (Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional) — Secret Police

**Establishment**:
- Secretly created by Pinochet in November 1973; officially established by Decree 521 on June 14, 1974
- Headed by Colonel Manuel Contreras, who reported directly to Pinochet
- U.S. State Department described it as "a Gestapo-type police force"
- CIA maintained close contact with DINA; Contreras was a paid CIA contact until 1977

**Operations**:
- Conducted mass arrests, torture, disappearances, and extrajudicial executions
- Operated network of clandestine detention and torture centers
- Targeted leftists, MIR members, Communist and Socialist Party members, union leaders
- Responsible for majority of human rights violations in 1973-1977

**Dissolution and Successor**:
- DINA dissolved in 1977 following international pressure after Letelier assassination
- Replaced by CNI (Centro Nacional de Informaciones) which continued repression until 1990

### Operation Condor — Regional Coordination

**Establishment**:
On November 25, 1975 (Pinochet's 60th birthday), intelligence chiefs from Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay met in Santiago to formally create Operation Condor. Brazil later joined.

**Purpose**:
- Coordinate cross-border tracking, detention, torture, and assassination of political opponents
- Share intelligence and prisoners between participating dictatorships
- Described as "something similar to INTERPOL but dedicated to Subversion"

**Key Operations**:
- **Letelier-Moffitt Assassination (September 21, 1976)**: Orlando Letelier, former Chilean ambassador to the U.S., and his American colleague Ronni Karpen Moffitt were killed by car bomb in Washington, D.C. This was primarily a DINA operation using Paraguayan support.
- Cross-border operations throughout South America targeting exiled dissidents
- First international court ruling (2016) declared Condor a "criminal conspiracy to forcibly disappear people"

### Disappearances (Desaparecidos)

**Scale**:
- 1,248 people officially listed as "disappeared" according to Rettig Report
- Bodies were hidden in mine shafts, the Atacama Desert, dumped at sea, or destroyed

**Methods**:
- Victims arrested by plainclothes agents, often at night
- Families given no information about whereabouts
- Regime denied holding victims while secretly detaining, torturing, and killing them
- Bodies often never recovered; legal limbo for families

### Torture Centers

**Major Detention/Torture Sites**:

**Villa Grimaldi (Cuartel Terranova)**:
- Main DINA torture center in Santiago (1974-1978)
- Estimated 4,500 people detained; at least 226 permanently disappeared
- Notable prisoners included future President Michelle Bachelet and her mother
- Torture methods: electric shock on "la parrilla" (metal bed frame), waterboarding, sexual violence, hanging, beatings
- "The Tower": Multi-story structure where many prisoners spent their final days
- "Chile houses": Wooden closet-like cells for standing solitary confinement
- DINA destroyed most buildings when abandoning site; now a memorial park (opened 1997)

**National Stadium (Estadio Nacional)**:
- Converted to mass detention center September 12 - November 7, 1973
- Over 12,000 detainees in first two months; up to 40,000 total during junta
- Men held on field and galleries; women in swimming pool changing rooms
- "Caracola" (velodrome toilet block) used for torture due to water supply
- Estimated 400-500 people killed within stadium
- Soviet Union forfeited 1974 World Cup qualifier refusing to play in stadium "stained with blood"
- Section "Escotilla 8" preserved as memorial since 2011

**Other sites**: Over 1,000 torture sites identified, including schools, hospitals, police stations, and military bases throughout Chile.

### Media Control

**Suppression of Opposition Media**:
- All left-wing newspapers closed immediately after coup
- Many center and center-right publications also eliminated
- State television seized and placed under direct regime control
- Laws passed restricting journalistic investigation under "state security"
- 400 journalists lost jobs; 200 exiled; 14 imprisoned by April 1975
- Scores of journalists killed or disappeared

**El Mercurio and Regime Cooperation**:
- El Mercurio newspaper had received ~$2 million CIA funding since 1970
- Pinochet in 1975: "El Mercurio is a bulwark against totalitarianism"
- Newspaper published propaganda claiming disappeared persons had died in internal leftist disputes
- Media duopoly of El Mercurio and Copesa consolidated during dictatorship
- Lack of media pluralism persists in Chile today

### Economic Policies — The "Chicago Boys"

**Origins**:
- 1955: U.S. State Department "Chile Project" trained Chilean economists at University of Chicago under Milton Friedman
- ~100 Chilean students trained 1957-1970, returning with free-market ideology
- After 1973 coup, these "Chicago Boys" given control of economic policy

**Key Policies**:

- Privatization of state-owned enterprises
- Deregulation and removal of trade barriers
- Cuts to government spending and social programs
- Pension system privatization (1981)
- Labor law reforms weakening unions

**Results and Costs**:

---

## Scholarly Debate

### The "Economic Miracle" Controversy

**Pro-"Miracle" Arguments**:
- Chile achieved highest per capita income in Latin America by 1998
- Economic growth averaged 7% annually in later period
- Poverty reduced from 48% (1988) to 20% (2000)
- Inflation brought under control
- Model influenced global economic policy

**Critical Arguments**:
- 1975: GDP fell 13%; unemployment reached 20%
- 1982 crisis: GDP fell 15%; unemployment exceeded 30%
- GINI coefficient of 0.57 in 1990 — extreme inequality
- Poverty was 68% by current standards in 1990
- Real wages remained below 1970 levels throughout dictatorship
- Growth occurred mainly 1985-1997, not immediately after reforms
- Synthetic control studies suggest Chile underperformed for 15 years after coup

**Current Assessment**:
Economic growth did eventually occur but:
- Not clearly attributable to Pinochet specifically
- Came at enormous human and social cost
- Inequality remained extreme
- Benefits concentrated among wealthy

### U.S. Complicity

**Established Facts**:
- CIA funded opposition to Allende ($8 million in covert actions 1970-1973)
- Nixon ordered CIA to "make the economy scream"
- CIA had intelligence relationships with coup plotters
- U.S. was aware of coup planning days in advance
- Contreras was paid CIA contact until 1977 (despite Letelier investigation)

**Debate**:
- Did U.S. directly orchestrate coup or merely create conditions?
- Kissinger: They "created the conditions as great as possible"
- Nixon: "Our hand doesn't show on this one"
- Church Committee (1975): "Extensive and continuous" U.S. involvement 1963-1973

### Transitional Justice Model

**Chile's Approach**:
- Truth commissions over criminal trials
- Limited prosecutions due to amnesty law
- Reparations to victims
- "Pacted transition" negotiated with military

**Debate**:
- **Positive view**: Avoided civil war; achieved stable democracy; truth commission model influential globally
- **Critical view**: Impunity for perpetrators; amnesty law still in force; Pinochet died unconvicted; justice denied to victims

**International Impact**:
- Pinochet arrest established universal jurisdiction precedent
- Chile's truth commission model adopted by other countries
- Debate over whether stability or justice should be prioritized in transitions

## Comparisons
- [[argentina-junta]] — relationship: temporal (Operation Condor partner; similar methods)
- [[brazil-military]] — relationship: temporal (Operation Condor partner; Cold War military dictatorship)
- [[spain-franco]] — relationship: thematic (right-wing authoritarian; economic liberalization debate)
- [[indonesia-suharto]] — relationship: thematic (Cold War anti-communist dictatorship; U.S. support)

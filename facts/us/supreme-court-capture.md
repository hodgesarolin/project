# Supreme Court Capture: The Long Game, Anti-Democratic Decisions, and Legitimacy Crisis

> **This is analysis with sourced facts.** This document combines factual reporting with analytical interpretation. All major claims are sourced.

## Thesis

The current 6-3 conservative supermajority on the U.S. Supreme Court represents the culmination of a decades-long, well-funded strategy to capture the federal judiciary. Through a combination of dark money funding, the creation of a judicial pipeline via the Federalist Society, unprecedented procedural obstructionism by Senate Republicans, and ethical failures by sitting justices, the Court has been transformed into an institution that increasingly undermines democratic governance while suffering a profound legitimacy crisis.

## Part I: The Long Game (1982-Present)

### The Federalist Society Founding (1982)

The Federalist Society was founded in 1982 as a student organization at Yale Law School by Steven Calabresi, David McIntosh, and Lee Liberman Otis. The organization also had early chapters at the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School. [Yale Daily News](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2024/11/04/how-the-federalist-society-shaped-americas-judiciary/)

**Key founding fact**: The first faculty advisor at the University of Chicago was Antonin Scalia, who would later become a Supreme Court justice. [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Federalist-Society)

The organization describes itself as a debating society that hosts political events and acts as a network for conservative and libertarian students and professionals. However, it has grown into the most influential legal organization in American history for shaping the federal judiciary.

### Leonard Leo: The Architect

Leonard Leo became one of the first paid employees of the Federalist Society's national office in 1991. Under his leadership, the organization expanded dramatically:

- **1991**: 2 student chapters, ~$100,000 budget
- **2024**: Over 90 chapters, $20+ million budget
- **By 2024**: 6 of 9 Supreme Court justices are members or affiliates of the Federalist Society

[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/we-dont-talk-about-leonard-leo-supreme-court-supermajority), [WBUR](https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2023/12/20/man-behind-the-u-s-judiciarys-shift-right-leonard-leo)

Leo's stated strategy was explicit about creating a pipeline:

> "The key was to figure out how to develop what I call a 'pipeline'âbasically, where you recruit students in law school, you get them through law school, they come out of law school, and then you find ways of continuing to involve them in legal policy."

[The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/leonard-leo-federalist-society-courts/)

**Leo's direct influence on the current Court:**
- Advised Trump on nominations of Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett
- Helped pick or confirm Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, and Samuel Alito

[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/we-dont-talk-about-leonard-leo-supreme-court-supermajority)

A 2023 study found that a judicial nominee's affiliation with the Federalist Society increased the probability of successful Senate confirmation by approximately 20%. In 2021, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse noted that 86% of Trump's Supreme Court or appellate court nominees were members of the organization. [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonard-Leo)

### Dark Money Infrastructure

#### Donors Trust: The "Dark Money ATM"

Donors Trust has been described as a "dark money ATM" used by billionaires as a pass-through vehicle to disguise donations to conservative groups. Key facts:

- In 2018, more than 99% of the Judicial Education Project's funding came from a single $7.8 million donation from Donors Trust
- From 2012 to 2019, the 85 Fund (then operating as Judicial Education Project) was almost exclusively funded through Donors Trust
- The 85 Fund received more than $20 million in 2020 from Donors Trust

[OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/12/conservative-dark-money-group-raised-record-50m-in-2020-after-election-rebranding/), [ACS Law](https://www.acslaw.org/analysis/reports/dark-money/)

#### The $1.6 Billion Single Donation

In 2020, 91-year-old electronics magnate Barre Seid made the largest single contribution to a politically focused nonprofit ever made public: **$1.6 billion** to Marble Freedom Trust, a group led by Leonard Leo.

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/22/politics/dark-money-donation-conservative-group-invs/index.html), [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/dark-money-leonard-leo-barre-seid)

#### Total Dark Money Spending

Between 2005 and mid-2021, Leo and his associates raised at least $460 million (not including the Marble Freedom Trust funds). Between 2014 and 2020, tax records show groups in his orbit raised more than $600 million.

**Key donors include:**
- Hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer
- Texas real estate magnate Harlan Crow
- The Koch family

[The Week](https://theweek.com/leonard-leo/1025358/the-hidden-architect-of-the-supreme-court)

#### Judicial Crisis Network Spending

The Judicial Crisis Network received:
- Two separate anonymous $17 million donations
- Another $38 million from an anonymous LLC between 2016 and 2018

Spending:
- At least **$17 million** on advertisements opposing Judge Merrick Garland and supporting Justice Neil Gorsuch
- At least **$12 million** on advertisements supporting Justice Brett Kavanaugh

## Part II: McConnell's Obstruction

### The Merrick Garland Blockade (2016)

**Key Timeline:**
- **February 13, 2016**: Justice Antonin Scalia dies
- **February 13, 2016**: Before Obama could announce any nominee, McConnell declares the Senate will not hold hearings on any replacement
- **March 16, 2016**: Obama nominates Merrick Garland, Chief Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals
- **293 days**: The vacancy remains unfilled through Election Day
- **January 3, 2017**: Garland's nomination expires without a hearing

[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/29/624467256/what-happened-with-merrick-garland-in-2016-and-why-it-matters-now)

McConnell's justification: "Let the people decide" in the upcoming election, claiming it was improper to confirm a justice in a presidential election year when the president and Senate majority were of opposing parties.

McConnell later boasted: "One of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.'"

[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/what-happened-merrick-garland-what-mcconnell-trump-others-said-did-during-obamas-nomination-1537842)

### The Amy Coney Barrett Reversal (2020)

**Contrasting Timeline:**
- **September 18, 2020**: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies (46 days before election)
- **September 26, 2020**: Trump nominates Amy Coney Barrett (8 days after Ginsburg's death, 37 days before election)
- **October 26, 2020**: Barrett confirmed by 52-48 vote

**Comparison:**
| Factor | Garland (2016) | Barrett (2020) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Days before election | 236 days | 46 days |
| Time to nomination | N/A | 8 days |
| Hearing held | No | Yes |
| Confirmed | No | Yes |

[PBS Frontline](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/on-night-of-ginsburgs-death-mcconnell-pushed-trump-to-nominate-amy-coney-barrett/)

### Documented Hypocrisy

**31 Republican senators** who refused to consider Merrick Garland because his nomination was in an election year supported moving forward with Amy Coney Barrett's nomination right before the 2020 election.

[Ms. Magazine](https://msmagazine.com/2020/10/02/merrick-garland-amy-coney-barrett-republican-senators-hypocrisy/)

**Senator Lindsey Graham's 2016 promise:**
> "I want you to use my words against me. If there is a Republican president in 2020, and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said let's let the next president, whoever it might be, make that nomination."

Graham voted to confirm Barrett.

McConnell's defense: "There's nothing unconstitutional about it. It doesn't break any rules. The majority decides whether to vote or not."

McConnell biographer Michael Tackett called the Garland blockade "brutish" and "the sheer exercise of power... a total concoction to give the gloss of authority for what he wanted to do."

[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/behind-mitch-mcconnell-supreme-court-engineering-60-minutes/)

### The Nuclear Option (2017)

To confirm Neil Gorsuch, McConnell invoked the "nuclear option," changing Senate rules to allow Supreme Court nominations to be advanced by simple majority (51 votes) rather than the traditional 60-vote threshold for cloture.

This rule change enabled all three Trump Supreme Court confirmations.

---

## Part III: The Current Court - The 6-3 Conservative Supermajority

### Justice Clarence Thomas

**Appointed by**: George H.W. Bush (1991)
**Confirmation vote**: 52-48 (one of the closest in history)
**Background**: Federal appellate judge; former EEOC chairman

Thomas's 1991 confirmation was marked by testimony from Anita Hill alleging sexual harassment. Thomas called the hearings a "high-tech lynching."

**Current tenure**: Longest-serving justice on the current Court

#### Thomas Ethics Scandals: The Harlan Crow Revelations

In April 2023, ProPublica began publishing an investigative series that exposed extensive unreported gifts from billionaire Republican donor Harlan Crow to Justice Thomas over more than 20 years.

[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow)

**Key findings:**

**1. Luxury Travel**
- In late June 2019, Thomas took a private jet to Indonesia for a nine-day vacation on Crow's 162-foot superyacht with private chef and attendants
- Estimated cost if Thomas had paid: **$500,000+**
- At least six undisclosed trips to Bohemian Grove with Crow
- Additional private jet flights to Glacier National Park area in Montana and to Thomas's hometown in Georgia

[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-jet-flights-senate-investigation-scotus)

**2. Tuition Payments**
- Crow paid tuition for Thomas's grandnephew for two years at private boarding schools
- Estimated value: **~$100,000**
- Not disclosed on required financial forms

[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-tuition-martin-school)

**Legal Requirements Violated:**

The Ethics in Government Act (passed post-Watergate) requires Supreme Court justices to report most gifts worth more than $415. All seven legal ethics experts consulted by ProPublica said the law's language clearly requires disclosure of gifts of transportation like private jet travel and yacht cruises.

[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-response-trips-legal-experts-harlan-crow)

**Thomas's Response:**

Initially, Thomas defended his failure to disclose, stating he was advised that "personal hospitality from close personal friends, who did not have business before the Court, was not reportable."

In a later amended financial disclosure, Thomas acknowledged he "inadvertently omitted" certain trips.

[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-gift-disclosures-harlan-crow)

**Senate Response:**

Senator Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, stated: "The highest court in the land should not have the lowest ethical standards."

[ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-harlan-crow-durbin-ethics-investigation)

### Justice Samuel Alito

**Appointed by**: George W. Bush (2006)
**Confirmation vote**: 58-42
**Background**: Federal appellate judge (Third Circuit since 1990)

Alito's confirmation was notable: the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10-8 along party linesâthe first purely partisan committee vote on a Supreme Court nominee since Louis Brandeis in 1916.

#### Alito Ethics Controversy: The Flag Scandal

In May 2024, the New York Times reported that an upside-down American flagâa symbol adopted by the "Stop the Steal" movementâflew outside Alito's Virginia home in mid-January 2021, days after the January 6th Capitol attack.

Subsequently, it was revealed that an "Appeal to Heaven" flag (also associated with the January 6th movement) flew at his New Jersey beach home.

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/alito-flag-controversy-response-supreme-court/index.html)

**Recusal Demands:**

Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts called for Alito to recuse himself from cases involving the 2020 election and January 6th events.

**Alito's Response:**

Alito refused to recuse, writing to lawmakers:
- "The two incidents you cite do not meet the conditions for recusal."
- "I had nothing whatsoever to do with the flying of that flag."
- "As soon as I saw it, I asked my wife to take it down, but for several days, she refused."
- "My wife is fond of flying flags. I am not."

Alito blamed the upside-down flag on a "very nasty" dispute with a neighbor.

[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/29/g-s1-1617/justice-alito-flags-jan-6), [SCOTUSblog](https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/05/alito-reject-calls-to-recuse-from-trump-jan-6-cases-in-light-of-flag-controversies/)

Chief Justice Roberts rejected Senate Democrats' request to discuss the Alito flag controversy.

[WHYY](https://whyy.org/articles/justice-roberts-rejects-request-to-discuss-alito-flag-controversy-supreme-court-ethics/)

### Chief Justice John Roberts

**Appointed by**: George W. Bush (2005)
**Confirmation vote**: 78-22
**Background**: Federal appellate judge (D.C. Circuit); former Deputy Solicitor General

Roberts was originally nominated to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor but was elevated to Chief Justice nomination after William Rehnquist's death.

Roberts has occasionally been the swing vote, but has presided over the Court's rightward shift and has been criticized for inadequate response to ethics concerns.

### Justice Neil Gorsuch

**Appointed by**: Donald Trump (2017)
**Confirmation vote**: 54-45
**Background**: Federal appellate judge (10th Circuit); former law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy

Gorsuch occupies the seat that would have gone to Merrick Garland. His confirmation required the nuclear option to overcome Democratic opposition.

**Federalist Society connection**: Strong ties to the organization; vetted and recommended by Leonard Leo.

### Justice Brett Kavanaugh

**Appointed by**: Donald Trump (2018)
**Confirmation vote**: 50-48 (one of the closest in history)
**Background**: Federal appellate judge (D.C. Circuit); former law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy; former staff secretary under George W. Bush

Kavanaugh's confirmation was marked by allegations of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford, leading to dramatic Senate testimony and a limited FBI investigation.

**Federalist Society connection**: Member; vetted and recommended by Leonard Leo.

### Justice Amy Coney Barrett

**Appointed by**: Donald Trump (2020)
**Confirmation vote**: 52-48
**Background**: Federal appellate judge (7th Circuit since 2017); Notre Dame Law School professor for 15 years

Barrett was confirmed just 8 days before the 2020 election to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg, reversing the Garland precedent.

**Federalist Society connection**: Member; vetted and recommended by Leonard Leo.

## Part IV: Anti-Democratic Decisions

### 1. Bush v. Gore (2000) - Stopping the Count

**Case**: Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000)
**Vote**: 5-4 (to stop recount)
**Date**: December 12, 2000

**Background:**
- November 8, 2000: Initial Florida count shows Bush leading Gore by ~1,700 votes
- Automatic machine recount triggered (margin less than 0.5%)
- December 8: Florida Supreme Court orders statewide manual recount of over 61,000 undervotes

**The Decision:**
- December 9: Five conservative justices (Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas) grant emergency stay halting recount
- December 12: Court rules 7-2 that varying recount standards violated Equal Protection, but 5-4 that no remedy was possible given time constraints
- With only 2 hours remaining until the state deadline, the recount effectively ended

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_v._Gore)

**Unprecedented limitation**: The majority wrote that their decision should be "limited to the present circumstances" and not set precedentâan extraordinary instruction for a Supreme Court ruling.

**Democratic impact:**
- In at least 15 Florida counties, undervotes were never manually reviewed
- Citizens' votes were "effectively erased from the final tally"
- Started a "long slide in public approval for the court, accentuated by a widening partisan gap"

[State Court Report](https://statecourtreport.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/supreme-court-and-election-law-still-feel-fallout-25-years-after-bush-v), [The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/4357812-bush-v-gore-destroyed-us/)

**Justice Stevens's dissent:**
> "Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law."

### 2. Citizens United v. FEC (2010) - Money as Speech

**Case**: Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010)
**Vote**: 5-4
**Majority**: Kennedy, Roberts, Scalia, Alito, Thomas
**Date**: January 21, 2010

**The Decision:**
The Court struck down restrictions on independent political expenditures by corporations, ruling that such spending is protected political speech under the First Amendment.

[Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained)

**Key Holdings:**
- Corporations have First Amendment rights
- Political speech "is indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation"
- "Independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption"

**Consequences:**
- Created super PACs (following the related SpeechNow.org v. FEC decision)
- Dark money expenditures increased from less than $5 million in 2006 to more than **$1 billion** in the 2024 presidential elections alone
- Overwhelming majorities of Americans have consistently expressed disapproval of the ruling
- At least 22 states and hundreds of cities have voted to support a constitutional amendment to overturn it

[Roosevelt Institute](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/citizens-united-15-years-later/), [Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/fifteen-years-later-citizens-united-defined-2024-election)

**Justice Stevens's dissent:**
- Expressed concern that the decision would cause citizens to "lose faith in our democracy"
- Argued that legal entities like corporations are not "We the People" for whom the Constitution was established

**President Obama's response:**
> "This ruling strikes at our democracy itself... gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washingtonâwhile undermining the influence of average Americans."

### 3. Shelby County v. Holder (2013) - Gutting the Voting Rights Act

**Case**: Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013)
**Vote**: 5-4
**Majority**: Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Alito
**Date**: June 25, 2013

**Background:**
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 required states and jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to get federal approval ("preclearance") before changing voting laws.

**The Decision:**
The Court struck down Section 4(b) of the VRAâthe formula determining which jurisdictions required preclearanceâas unconstitutional because it was based on outdated data.

[Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/effects-shelby-county-v-holder-voting-rights-act)

**Immediate Effects:**
- **Same day**: Texas announced implementation of the nation's most restrictive voter ID law (previously blocked under preclearance)
- **Same day**: Mississippi announced it would move forward with a new voter photo ID law

[NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/case-issue/shelby-county-v-holder/)

**Long-Term Effects:**
- 19 states have since implemented restrictive voter ID laws
- Closure of polling places
- Shortened early voting periods
- Enabled racial gerrymandering
- Congress has not passed a new coverage formula, leaving preclearance effectively inoperable

[NAACP LDF - Impact](https://www.naacpldf.org/shelby-county-v-holder-impact/)

**Chief Justice Roberts's reasoning:**
> "Our country has changed" since 1965, and the formula was no longer justified by current conditions.

**Justice Ginsburg's dissent:**
> "Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."

### 4. Rucho v. Common Cause (2019) - Partisan Gerrymandering OK

**Case**: Rucho v. Common Cause, 588 U.S. 684 (2019)
**Vote**: 5-4
**Majority**: Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh
**Date**: June 27, 2019

**The Decision:**
The Court held that partisan gerrymandering claims are "nonjusticiable political questions" that federal courts lack authority to decide.

[The American Redistricting Project](https://thearp.org/litigation/rucho-v-common-cause/)

**Key Holdings:**
- While partisan gerrymandering may be "incompatible with democratic principles," federal courts cannot review such claims
- The Court could not identify "judicially discoverable and manageable standards" for resolving such cases

[Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/rucho-v-common-cause)

**Effect:**
- State legislatures can draw congressional maps for partisan advantage without federal court oversight
- Only racial gerrymandering remains reviewable
- States and Congress would need to enact their own limits on partisan gerrymandering

**Justice Kagan's dissent:**
> "For the first time ever, this Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities."

### 5. Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022) - Overturning Roe

**Case**: Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215 (2022)
**Vote**: 6-3 (to reverse lower courts); 5-4 (to overturn Roe)
**Majority to overturn Roe**: Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett
**Date**: June 24, 2022

**The Decision:**
The Court held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, overruling both Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992).

[Constitution Center](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/supreme-court-case-library/dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization)

**Key Arguments:**
- Abortion is not mentioned in the Constitution
- It is not "deeply rooted in the Nation's history and traditions"
- At the time of the 14th Amendment, three-quarters of states criminalized abortion at any stage

**Justice Alito's majority opinion** (leaked in May 2022):
> "Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences."

**Effect:**
- 26 states had bans ready to enact; 13 were "trigger laws" taking immediate effect
- The issue returned to state legislatures
- As of 2022, the only remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi (the case's plaintiff) faced closure

[Center for Reproductive Rights](https://reproductiverights.org/case/scotus-mississippi-abortion-ban/)

**Note on confirmation testimony:**
All three Trump appointees (Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett) had suggested during confirmation hearings that Roe was settled precedent deserving respect.

[FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/05/what-gorsuch-kavanaugh-and-barrett-said-about-roe-at-confirmation-hearings/)

### 6. Moore v. Harper (2023) - Independent State Legislature Theory (Rejected)

**Case**: Moore v. Harper, 600 U.S. 1 (2023)
**Vote**: 6-3 (rejecting ISL theory)
**Majority**: Roberts, Sotomayor, Kagan, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Jackson
**Dissent**: Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch
**Date**: June 27, 2023

**The Theory:**
The "Independent State Legislature Theory" (ISL) argued that state legislatures have sole authority to establish election rules for federal elections without judicial review by state courts, gubernatorial veto, or constraint by state constitutions.

[Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/moore-v-harper-explained)

**The Decision:**
The Court rejected ISL, holding that state legislatures remain subject to state court review and state constitutional provisions when drawing congressional maps or making election rules.

[Democracy Docket](https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/u-s-supreme-court-rejects-independent-state-legislature-theory-in-moore-v-harper/)

**Significance:**
- A ruling accepting ISL could have allowed state legislatures to override popular votes or draw unlimited gerrymanders
- The rejection was a rare win for democracy advocates
- However, **three justices (Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch) appeared to embrace ISL**

[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/28/1184631859/what-the-supreme-courts-rejection-of-a-controversial-theory-means-for-elections)

### 7. Trump v. United States (2024) - Presidential Immunity

**Case**: Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2024)
**Vote**: 6-3
**Majority**: Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh (Barrett partial)
**Dissent**: Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson
**Date**: July 1, 2024

**The Decision:**
The Court held that former presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts, establishing a three-tiered framework:

1. **Absolute immunity** for "core constitutional powers" (pardons, military command, control of executive branch)
2. **Presumptive immunity** for other official acts
3. **No immunity** for unofficial/private acts

[Constitutional Accountability Center](https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/trump-v-united-states/), [SCOTUSblog](https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/07/justices-rule-trump-has-some-immunity-from-prosecution/)

**Specific ruling:**
The Court found that Trump's discussions with the Acting Attorney General about the 2020 election were "within his exclusive constitutional authority" and therefore "absolutely immune from prosecution."

**Justice Sotomayor's dissent:**
> "The President is now a king above the law."

[Brennan Center](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/supreme-courts-presidential-immunity-ruling-undermines-democracy)

**Effect:**
- Case returned to lower courts to determine which charged conduct was "official" vs. "unofficial"
- Effectively delayed any trial until after the 2024 election
- Case was ultimately dismissed after Trump's 2024 election victory

[Center for American Progress](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trump-v-united-states-revisiting-the-presidential-immunity-ruling-1-year-later/)

### 8. Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024) - Overturning Chevron Deference

**Case**: Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024)
**Vote**: 6-3
**Majority**: Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett
**Dissent**: Kagan, Sotomayor (Jackson recused)
**Date**: June 28, 2024

**Background:**
Since 1984, "Chevron deference" required courts to defer to federal agencies' reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes they administer.

**The Decision:**
The Court overturned the 40-year-old Chevron doctrine, holding that courts must exercise "independent judgment" in deciding whether agencies have acted within statutory authority.

[White & Case](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-chevron-doctrine-what-you-need-know)

**Chief Justice Roberts's reasoning:**
> Chevron conflicts with the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires courts to decide "all relevant questions of law."

**Impact:**
- Fundamentally changes federal regulatory landscape
- Studies found courts applied Chevron deference 77% of the time; agencies were significantly more likely to win when afforded deference
- Agency rules and orders are now more vulnerable to legal challenges
- The decision "went further than even the most ardent opponents of Chevron deference thought possible"

[American Bar Association](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2024-august/end-chevron-deference-what-does-it-mean-what-comes-next/), [DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en-us/insights/publications/2024/06/chevron-overruled-in-loper-bright-v-raimondo)

**Implications:**
- Environmental regulations
- Consumer protections
- Worker safety rules
- Financial regulations
- Healthcare policies

All face increased vulnerability to judicial challenges.

## Part V: The Ethics Crisis

### Lack of Binding Ethics Code

Until November 2023, the Supreme Court operated without any formal code of conductâthe only federal court to do so.

**November 2023**: Following sustained public criticism over gifts and undisclosed relationships with wealthy benefactors, the Court adopted its first-ever code of conduct.

**Critical flaw**: The code has **no enforcement mechanism**.

[ProPublica](https://gijn.org/stories/propublica-exposed-ethics-scandals-us-supreme-court/), [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-justice-alito-wont-recuse-over-flags/)

### Recusal Failures

**The Problem:**
Justices decide for themselves whether to recuse from cases, with no review or appeal of these decisions.

**Thomas and Alito:**
- Neither recused from cases involving January 6th or Trump's election claims despite:
  - Thomas's wife Ginni Thomas's involvement in "Stop the Steal" efforts
  - Alito's display of flags associated with the movement
- Both participated in Trump v. United States despite apparent conflicts

**Roberts's Response:**
Chief Justice Roberts has consistently rejected Congressional requests to discuss ethics concerns, asserting the Court's independence from legislative oversight.

### The ProPublica Investigation's Broader Impact

ProPublica's investigative series "provided rare, behind-the-scenes details" and "prompted historic reforms on the nation's high court"âthough critics argue the reforms remain inadequate without enforcement.

The series plunged "the Supreme Court into its biggest ethical crisis in the modern era."

## Part VI: The Legitimacy Crisis

### Public Approval Collapse

**Historical Trend:**
- **August 2020**: 70% of Americans had favorable view of the Court
- **2024**: Approval ranged between 39% and 48% throughout the year
- **August 2025**: Favorable rating at lowest point in surveys dating to 1987

[Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/09/03/favorable-views-of-supreme-court-remain-near-historic-low/), [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1128124/share-adults-us-approve-supreme-court/)

**Post-Dobbs Polarization:**
Research published in Science Advances found that the Dobbs decision "polarized the public's views of the Supreme Court along partisan lines for the first time in decades."

[Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk9590)

### Partisan Divide in Court Perception

| Group | Approval | Favorable View |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Republicans | 81% | 71% |
| Independents | 43% | â |
| Democrats | 19% | 26% |

### Public Perception of Impartiality

- **56%** say justices' decisions are "based mainly on politics"
- **44%** say decisions are "based mainly on the law"
- In 2019, only 35% said politics was the main motivation
- Since July 2023, 50%+ have consistently said politics motivates decisions
- **Only 20%** of Americans view the Court as "politically neutral" (June 2025)
- **7 in 10** think justices are "more influenced by ideology"

### Constitutional Crisis Concerns

An April 2025 Elon University poll found:
- **67%** of Americans express concern about a potential constitutional crisis arising from conflicts between the executive branch and the courts

### Reform Proposals

**Term Limits:**
- **78%** of Americans support term limits (up 12 points from 2022)
- **67%** support (including 57% of Republicans, 82% of Democrats)
- Manchin-Welch proposal: 18-year terms with rotating chief justice
- Supreme Court Term Limits and Regular Appointments Act of 2025 introduced in House

**Court Expansion:**
- **46%** support increasing number of justices
- **51%** oppose
- **66%** of Democrats support; **27%** of Republicans support

**Ethics Code with Enforcement:**
- **86%** of Democrats support
- **62%** of Republicans support

[Demand Justice](https://demandjustice.org/polling-roundup-supreme-court-approval-is-in-the-gutter-americans-demand-reform/)

**Biden Administration Proposals (July 2024):**
1. Enforceable code of ethics
2. 18-year term limits
3. Constitutional amendment reversing presidential immunity decision

[PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/biden-proposes-term-limits-and-ethics-code-for-supreme-court-justices)

### Constitutional Barriers to Reform

**Article III Challenge:**
The Constitution states federal judges "shall hold their offices during good behavior," widely interpreted to prohibit term limits without constitutional amendment.

**Proposed Workaround:**
Justices would retain life tenure and salary but participate in Supreme Court's apex appellate work for only 18 years, then serve as senior Article III judges on lower courts.

## Conclusion: Assessment

### What the Evidence Shows

1. **Coordinated Long-Term Strategy**: The Federalist Society and associated dark money networks executed a multi-decade plan to reshape the federal judiciary, with documented success.

2. **Norm Destruction**: McConnell's Garland blockade and Barrett reversal demonstrated that procedural norms would be discarded when politically advantageous.

3. **Ethical Failures**: Multiple justices have accepted significant unreported gifts from parties with ideological interests in Court outcomes, yet face no accountability.

4. **Pattern of Anti-Democratic Rulings**: From stopping vote counts (Bush v. Gore) to enabling unlimited dark money (Citizens United) to gutting voting protections (Shelby County) to permitting partisan gerrymandering (Rucho) to granting presidential immunity (Trump v. United States), the Court has consistently ruled in ways that reduce democratic accountability.

5. **Legitimacy Collapse**: Public trust has cratered, with majorities now viewing the Court as a political rather than judicial institution.

### Counter-Evidence

- Moore v. Harper rejected the most extreme version of ISL theory
- Chief Justice Roberts occasionally provides a swing vote on narrow issues
- The Court adopted an ethics code (though unenforceable)
- Some decisions have been unanimous across ideological lines

### Confidence Level

**High confidence** that:
- Dark money funded the campaign to reshape the judiciary
- McConnell engaged in unprecedented obstruction
- Ethics violations occurred and were inadequately addressed
- Public trust has significantly declined

**Medium confidence** that:
- The pattern of decisions reflects ideological capture rather than good-faith constitutional interpretation
- Reform proposals could address the legitimacy crisis

### What Would Change This Assessment

- Meaningful ethics enforcement with consequences
- Recusals in cases with apparent conflicts
- Decisions that prioritize democratic participation over partisan advantage
- Bipartisan judicial nominations process restored

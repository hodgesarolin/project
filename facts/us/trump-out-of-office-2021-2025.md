# Donald Trump: Post-Presidency Years (2021-2025)

## Overview

This document covers Donald Trump's activities from leaving office on January 20, 2021, through his return to the presidency on January 20, 2025.

# Part I: Post-Presidency Base Building (2021-2024)

## Mar-a-Lago: The "White House in Exile"

### Establishment as Political Headquarters

When Trump left the White House in January 2021, his aides scrambled to collect items he wanted to take and ship them to multiple locations, including Mar-a-Lago and a temporary transition office in Washington suburbs. The General Services Administration (GSA) worked with Trump aides to relocate the office, noting they would pay for only one location.

Since leaving office, Mar-a-Lago transformed into a **"White House in exile"** and the nerve center for some of the most extreme elements of the Republican Party's MAGA wing. A visit to the resort became an essential rite for Republican candidates seeking Trump's favor.

### Financial Impact

According to federal and state campaign finance filings through Q1 2024:
- More than **$4.7 million** spent on the property by candidates and political committees since Trump left office
- More than 60 Republicans in or running for Congress or state office spent money at Mar-a-Lago
- Most spending was on fundraisers, with the ultimate objective of securing an endorsement
- Trump's campaign and super PACs made up about a quarter of that total

## The "Big Lie" and Election Denialism

### Continued Claims (2021-2024)

Trump continued to insist the 2020 election was stolen after leaving office:

- **Mid-2021:** Told a group of historians the election was "rigged and lost"
- **2022:** Stated he should be declared president or a new election held "immediately"
- **Ongoing:** Maintained he won the 2020 election throughout the post-presidency period

**Source:** [NPR - Trump's 'Big Lie' endures and poses a threat to U.S. democracy](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/23/1065277246/trump-big-lie-jan-6-election)

### Public Opinion Impact

According to a CNN poll (summer 2021):
- **36%** of Americans did not believe Biden legitimately won the election
- **78%** of Republicans did not believe Biden legitimately won

Yale historian Timothy Snyder noted the "big lie" became embedded in law: at least **19 states** passed laws limiting ballot access following Trump's false claims.

### 2024 Election Fraud Narrative

Trump made at least **12 distinct false claims** in the two months before the 2024 election raising baseless doubts about election validity. The primary false claim centered on noncitizen voting - the "Big Lie 2.0."

## Endorsements and GOP Influence

### 2022 Primary Results

Trump flexed his political influence in 2022 Republican primaries with remarkable success:

| Nonincumbent loss rate | About 1 in 5 |

### Targeting Impeachment Supporters

Of the **10 House Republicans** who voted to impeach Trump after January 6:
- **4** opted to retire
- **4** lost primaries to Trump-backed challengers (Tom Rice, Peter Meijer, Jaime Herrera Beutler, Liz Cheney)
- **2** survived primaries (in one case, Trump didn't endorse a challenger)

### Liz Cheney Defeat (August 16, 2022)

The most prominent example of Trump's influence:

| Candidate | Spending | Result |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Liz Cheney | $8 million | Lost by 32+ points |
| Harriet Hageman (Trump-backed) | $3.5 million | Won decisively |

**Key Context:**
- Roughly **70%** of Wyoming voted for Trump in 2020
- Cheney's repudiation of Trump became "the red line for so many GOP voters"
- Cheney's allies assert she could have won if she had stood "in lock step with Trump"

### Willis Disqualification Controversy

**Timeline:**
1. **Early 2024:** Defendant Michael Roman filed motion alleging Willis had romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade

### Case Dismissal

- **Prosecutor:** Pete Skandalakis (Prosecuting Attorneys' Council executive director) took over the case
- Could not find another attorney willing to take the case

**Skandalakis Rationale:** "There is no realistic prospect that a sitting President will be compelled to appear in Georgia to stand trial... Donald J. Trump's current term as President... does not expire until January 20, 2029; by that point, eight years will have elapsed since the phone call at issue."

## Supreme Court Presidential Immunity Ruling

### Trump v. United States (July 1, 2024)

**Vote:** 6-3 (along ideological lines)

**Majority:** Roberts (author), Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett
**Dissent:** Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson

### Key Holdings

| Category | Immunity Level |
|----------|----------------|
| Core constitutional powers (pardon, military command, execution of laws, control of executive branch) | **Absolute immunity** |
| Other official acts | **Presumptive immunity** |
| Unofficial/private acts | **No immunity** |

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Trump v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._United_States)

### Application to January 6 Case

The Court ruled Trump's direction of Justice Department work is within exclusive constitutional authority - therefore **absolutely immune** from prosecution for discussions with DOJ officials.

**Source:** [Constitution Center - Breaking down the Trump immunity decision](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/breaking-down-the-trump-immunity-decision)

### Dissenting Opinion

**Justice Sotomayor:** "Never in the history of our Republic has a President had reason to believe that he would be immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to violate the criminal law. Moving forward, however, all former Presidents will be cloaked in such immunity."

Repeated characterization despite backlash and comparisons to Hitler's justifications for the Holocaust.

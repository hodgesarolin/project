## Overview

Project 2025, formally known as the **2025 Presidential Transition Project**, is a political initiative published in April 2023 by the Heritage Foundation with the stated goal of reshaping the U.S. federal government by consolidating executive power in favor of conservative policies. The project constitutes a comprehensive policy document, a personnel database for vetting and recommending staff loyal to a conservative administration, training programs, and a set of proposed executive orders for implementation.

## Part I: Origins and Organization

### The Heritage Foundation's Role

The Heritage Foundation, a longstanding conservative think tank founded in 1973, serves as the primary architect and coordinator of Project 2025. The foundation has a history of producing "Mandate for Leadership" documents dating back to the Reagan administration.

**Historical Context:**
- The first "Mandate for Leadership" was published more than 40 years ago
- The Reagan administration implemented nearly **half** of the ideas from the first edition by the end of his first year
- The Trump administration embraced nearly **64%** of the 2016 edition's policy solutions after one year

## Part III: Key Policy Proposals by Department

### Executive Power Expansion (Unitary Executive Theory)

**Core Philosophy:**
Project 2025 is based on a controversial interpretation of **unitary executive theory**, which asserts the president has complete power to control the executive branch. The theory is derived from Article II of the Constitution, which states executive power "shall be vested" in the president.

**Key Proposals:**
- Place the entire federal bureaucracy under direct presidential control
- Eliminate independence of DOJ, FBI, FCC, FTC, and other agencies
- Remove civil service protections from thousands of federal employees
- Replace career civil servants with political appointees loyal to the president

**Historical Context:** The Reagan administration first developed the theory "as they sought to advance a deregulatory agenda." Since then, the Supreme Court's conservative majority has increasingly embraced stronger unitary executive interpretations.

**Expert Criticism:**
- Professor Don Moynihan (University of Michigan): "If you worry about a more authoritarian turn to American government, that theory really facilitates that by placing so much power into the hands of the president."
- Phillip Wallach (American Enterprise Institute): Characterized the project as "visions that bleed into authoritarian fantasies."
- Kim Wehle (Legal Expert): "This is just a massive dismantling of a delicately created system of checks and balances."

### Department of Justice Politicization

**Chapter Author:** Gene Hamilton (former DOJ official)

**Key Proposals:**

1. **Eliminate DOJ Independence**
   - Kevin Roberts: "We just disagree wholly that the Department of Justice is independent of the president or the executive branch"
   - Place DOJ under direct presidential control

2. **Expand Political Appointees**
   - Vastly expand number of political appointees in every DOJ office
   - Ensure appointees "promote the President's agenda"
   - Any employee who fails to obey political appointees can be immediately replaced

3. **Terminate Investigations**
   - Conduct comprehensive review of all major FBI investigations
   - Terminate any investigations "unlawful or contrary to the national interest"
   - Use DOJ as instrument for prosecuting political rivals

4. **Eliminate Consent Decrees**
   - "Promptly and properly eliminate all existing consent decrees"
   - Disclaim DOJ's ability to hand down consent decrees for police misconduct

**Expert Warning:**
Michael Bromwich (DOJ Inspector General 1994-1999): "The plans being developed by members of Trump's cult to turn the DOJ and FBI into instruments of his revenge should send shivers down the spine of anyone who cares about the rule of law."

### FBI Restructuring

**Key Proposals:**

1. **Change Reporting Structure**
   - Remove FBI from Deputy Attorney General supervision
   - Place under Assistant Attorney General for Criminal Division
   - "More politically accountable leadership" (critics: "code for loyal to the president")

### Civil Service Reform (Schedule F)

**Chapter Authors:** Donald Devine, Dennis Dean Kirk, Paul Dans

**What is Schedule F?**
Schedule F is an executive order classification that reclassifies certain federal positions as being of "a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character" and exempts them from competitive hiring and civil service protections.

**Timeline:**
- **October 2020:** Trump first issues Schedule F executive order
- **January 2021:** Biden revokes Schedule F on first day
- **January 20, 2025:** Trump reinstates Schedule F via executive order
- **2025:** Rebranded as "Schedule Policy/Career"

**Key Provisions:**
- Removes employment protections from career civil servants
- Allows dismissal of employees who "resist" presidential policy
- Creates category of "excepted service" outside civil service protections

**Estimated Impact:**
- OPM estimated **~50,000 federal workers** (2% of civilian workforce) would be reclassified
- Project 2025 envisions installing up to **50,000 conservative movement activists** in government
- Could affect "tens of thousands" of professional civil servants

**Expert Assessment:**
Don Moynihan (scholar): "Schedule F would be the most profound change to the civil service system since its creation in 1883."

Francis Fukuyama (political scientist): While the federal bureaucracy "is in dire need of reform," Schedule F would "dangerously undermine" the government's functionality.

   - End data collection on gender identity
   - Remove "non-binary" option from civil rights data collection

**Expert Response:**
Sasha Buchert (ACLU Non-Binary and Transgender Rights Project): Project 2025 is a "detailed and hateful plan... It relentlessly attacks LGBTQ people in a wide range of issue areas."

## Part IV: Personnel Database and Training

### Personnel Database

**Purpose:** Create a "conservative LinkedIn" for vetting and recommending candidates for 4,000+ political appointee positions.

**Leadership:** John McEntee (former Director of Presidential Personnel Office under Trump)

**Vetting Process:**
Candidates are screened on political stances including agreement with statements like:
- "Life has a right to legal protection from conception to natural death"
- "The President should be able to advance his/her agenda through the bureaucracy without hindrance from unelected federal officials"

**Features:**
- Open to public submissions
- Professional profiles reviewed by coalition members
- Pre-vetting reduces appointment complexity
- Candidates assessed on:
  - Professional qualifications
  - Alignment with conservative values
  - Commitment to project goals

**McEntee Statement:** "The Presidential Personnel Database will be of extraordinary value for the 47th president because we are doing a lot of the incoming administration's most important work ahead of time."

**Current Use (2025):**
- Trump transition team is actively scouting potential hires through database
- Staffers using database to fill 4,000+ political appointee positions
- "There's a lot of positions to fill and we continue to send names over, including ones from the database"

### Presidential Administration Academy (Training Programs)

**Purpose:** Prepare future conservative leaders for federal government service.

**Programs:**
1. **Online Courses**
   - Basics of government operations
   - "Conservative Governance 101" (Karoline Leavitt is an instructor)

2. **In-Person Seminars**
   - Advanced training for senior leadership
   - Strategic planning
   - Leadership expectations

**Goals:**
- Ensure appointees understand expectations from day one
- Establish performance benchmarks
- Train both new and experienced conservatives

## Part V: Schedule F Deep Dive

### Definition and Mechanism

**What Schedule F Does:**
- Reclassifies federal positions involved in policy-making
- Removes civil service protections including:
  - Protection from political firing
  - Due process rights
  - Merit-based advancement
- Allows president to hire/fire based on political loyalty

**Legal Basis:**
- Article II constitutional authority (claimed)
- OPM officials told agency HR leaders Trump has authority to remove career workers over "resistance to policy"

### Scope and Impact

**Number of Affected Workers:**
- OPM estimate: **~50,000 federal workers** (2% of civilian workforce)
- Some estimates suggest up to 100,000+ could eventually be affected
- Heritage goal: Install "as many as 50,000 conservative movement activists"

**Implementation Timeline:**
- January 20, 2025: Trump signed executive order reinstating Schedule F
- April 2025: Agencies required to share plans with OPM identifying policy-related roles for conversion
- Ongoing: Union lawsuits challenging implementation

### Expert Warnings

**Don Moynihan:** "Schedule F would be the most profound change to the civil service system since its creation in 1883."

**Francis Fukuyama:** While acknowledging need for reform, warned it would "dangerously undermine" government functionality.

**Critics' Concerns:**
- President and loyalists will have "full control of the Executive Branch for personal and political gain"
- Federal employees will be "powerless to stop" corruption, political overreach, or abuse of power
- Opens door to excepting civil service employees from protections

### DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency)

**Leadership:** Elon Musk (departed May 2025)

**Relationship to Project 2025:**
DOGE executed Project 2025's federal workforce reduction goals in "chaotic fashion" - eliminating agencies, firing tens of thousands, testing legal system.

**Outcomes:**
- Largest peacetime workforce reduction on record
- **Did NOT achieve spending goals:** Spent $7.6 trillion in first 11 months (higher than prior years)
- Claims of $214 billion savings disputed as inflated/overstated
- Original $1 trillion savings projection not achieved

**Status (December 2025):**
- DOGE quietly disbanded
- Most functions absorbed by OPM
- Musk called it "a little bit successful" but said he wouldn't do it again

**Consequences:**
- Social Security Administration: severe claim processing delays
- USAID shutdown: internal memo projected "hundreds of thousands of excess deaths"

### What's Been Blocked or Delayed

**Legal Challenges:**
- **Democracy 2025:** Coalition of hundreds of lawyers from 280 organizations to fight Project 2025 in courts
- **Birthright citizenship order:** Blocked by federal court preliminary injunction (February 2025)
- **Education Department certification requirements:** Blocked by federal court (April 2025)

**Policies Not Yet Implemented:**
- Head Start elimination (Trump backed off after leaked budget proposal)
- Some immigration court expansions face ongoing delays
- Various policies stuck in litigation

**Lesson from First Term:** ACLU's Anthony Romero noted every day a policy was blocked was a win, even if higher courts reinstated it. Trump's travel ban required three rewrites before Supreme Court approval.

**Project 2025's Expectation:** The document explicitly anticipates legal challenges, advising to "move forward, implement and worry about defending it in court later."

### Trump's Public Disavowals vs. Actual Implementation

**The Pattern:**

| What Trump Said | What Actually Happened |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| "I know nothing about Project 2025" | Heritage President Roberts said he "personally talked to President Trump about Project 2025" |
| "I have no idea who is behind it" | 140+ former Trump officials involved; Trump thanked Heritage at 2022 dinner |
| "I haven't read it" | Implemented ~50% of its goals in first year |
| "I have nothing to do with them" | Nominated 31+ Project 2025 contributors to administration |
| Campaign: "Should not be associated with the campaign" | Campaign used personnel database to staff transition |

**The About-Face (December 2024):**
Trump announced meeting with "Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame" - dramatic reversal from year of denials.

### Heritage Foundation Response

Kevin Roberts responded to criticism:
> "Project 2025 will not be 'stopped' by an unserious, mistake-riddled press release or a task force of House Democrats lacking a basic understanding of federal governance."

Heritage also pushed back on some Democratic claims, noting Project 2025 did not propose:
- Cuts to Social Security
- Changes to retirement age

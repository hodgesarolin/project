## Climate Crisis Current State

### IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Key Findings

The IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report (March 2023) represents the most comprehensive scientific assessment of climate change to date:

- **Current warming:** Global surface temperature was 1.1C higher in 2011-2020 compared to 1850-1900 baseline
- **1.5C threshold:** Likely to be reached in the early 2030s under current trajectories
- **2C threshold:** Could be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep emissions reductions occur
- **Warming scenarios:** Best estimates range from 1.4C (low emissions) to 4.4C (very high emissions) by 2100

> "Every increment of warming increases risks and impacts." - IPCC AR6

### 2024-2025 Developments

- In 2024, the planet temporarily breached the 1.5C threshold set by the Paris Agreement
- The Global Tipping Points Report 2025 synthesized findings from 160 authors across 23 countries and 87 institutions
- Warm water coral reefs are already crossing their thermal tipping point at 1.4C warming, experiencing unprecedented dieback

## Climate Tipping Points

### What Are Tipping Points?

A climate tipping point is a critical threshold that, when crossed, leads to large, accelerating, and often irreversible changes in the climate system. Climate scientist Timothy Lenton first identified these in 2008 and revisited them in 2022 with over a decade of additional data.

### Nine Core Tipping Elements

1. **Greenland Ice Sheet Disintegration**
2. **West Antarctic Ice Sheet Disintegration**
3. **East Antarctic Ice Sheet Disintegration**
4. **Arctic Sea Ice Decline**
5. **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) Collapse**
6. **Amazon Rainforest Dieback**
7. **Permafrost Thaw**
8. **Coral Reef Die-off**
9. **Mountain Glacier Retreat**

### Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)

The AMOC is a major ocean current system that circulates heat globally:

- Carries warm water northward from the tropics
- Freshwater from melting Greenland ice threatens the density-driven circulation
- A 2021 study found AMOC is at its weakest in over 1,600 years
- **Risk:** Collapse below 2C warming could radically undermine global food and water security and plunge northwest Europe into severe winters

### Amazon Rainforest

- Climate change and deforestation together put the Amazon at risk of widespread dieback below 2C
- Areas with greater than 75% tree canopy loss have been mapped from 2001 to 2024
- An AMOC collapse could worsen drought in the Amazon and accelerate Antarctic ice loss

### Permafrost

- Contains millennia of dead plants and animals locked in frozen ground
- When thawing, bacteria and fungi digest the carbon-rich soil, releasing methane and CO2
- "This new science is showing that this is happening right now" - Ted Schuur, permafrost expert
- The tipping point process has already begun

### Critical Thresholds

> "Minimising overshoot of 1.5C is essential to prevent climate tipping points. Every fraction of a degree and every year over 1.5C matters." - Global Tipping Points Report 2025

## Climate as Threat Multiplier

### Military and Security Assessments

The Department of Defense has increasingly recognized climate change as a national security threat:

- **Climate Risk Analysis (DCRA):** Pentagon assessments examine how climate affects military installations, operations, and strategic planning
- **National Defense Strategy:** Recent strategies incorporate climate as a factor in global instability
- **Installation Resilience:** DoD has assessed vulnerabilities of military bases to flooding, extreme heat, and wildfires
- **Arctic Security:** Melting Arctic ice opens new strategic waterways and increases competition with Russia and China

### Resource Conflicts

#### Water Scarcity Crisis

The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region represents a critical case study:

- Described as "the world's most water-stressed" region globally
- Experiencing almost continuous drought since 1998 - the most severe dry spell in 900 years (NASA)
- Home to 6% of world population but only 1% of freshwater resources (World Bank)

**Specific Country Impacts:**

| Country | Water/Food Crisis Status |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Iraq | 90% of rivers polluted; by 2035, resources meet only 15% of needs; lost 61% of irrigated agricultural land |
| Jordan | Among world's most water-stressed; 56% of Jordanians food insecure |
| Syria | 12 million food-insecure; 15.3 million need humanitarian assistance |
| Sudan | 30.4 million (>50% of population) need food assistance as of May 2025 |

#### Transboundary Water Tensions

- **Nile River Basin:** Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam has sparked disputes with Egypt over water rights
- **Tigris-Euphrates:** Dam construction and reduced flows strain relations among riparian nations
- Water has been weaponized in conflicts (Libya militias controlling the Great Man-Made River)

### Food Insecurity

- Global acute food insecurity rose from 149 million (pre-COVID) to 333 million in 2023
- 149 million Africans currently face acute food insecurity, mostly in conflict-affected areas
- North Africa 2023: Morocco saw 28% rainfall drop causing 20% decrease in agricultural output; Tunisia's cereal production fell 80%

### Climate-Conflict Nexus

The IPCC and WMO stress that climate change worsens existing geopolitical tensions by straining essential resources. Historical examples:

- **South Sudan:** Civil war onset (December 2013) coincided with severe drought conditions that exacerbated food insecurity and ethnic tensions
- **Syria:** Severe drought from 2006-2011 contributed to rural-urban migration and social instability preceding the civil war

## Climate Migration

### Current Scale

- The World Bank projects climate change could force 216 million people to move within their own countries by 2050
- Most climate displacement is internal rather than cross-border
- "Climate refugee" is not formally recognized under international refugee law

### Mediterranean Crisis

The Central Mediterranean is the deadliest known migration route in the world:

- 3,111 people died attempting to reach Europe in one period - a 77% increase from the prior year
- 2016 holds the record: 4,900 deaths despite arrivals dropping 60%
- Deaths caused by: length of journey, dangerous smuggling patterns, gaps in search-and-rescue, restrictions on NGO operations

### Border Militarization

EU border enforcement has intensified dramatically:

- EU paid 100 million euros to Airbus and Israeli arms companies for drone surveillance of refugees
- EU border agency (Frontex) funding increased by 67.4% in one year
- Border militarization is a booming industry growing at ~8% annually

**Impact on Migrant Safety:**
> "The ever-growing numbers of people attempting to cross the sea have to take riskier routes to avoid border patrols, while receiving significantly less assistance in cases of distress."

Increased Aegean patrols caused quick fall in crossings to Greece but pushed refugees to more dangerous routes, contributing to increased deaths.

## Authoritarian Climate Response

### Emergency Powers and Climate

Under existing emergency powers, a president may:
- Seize property
- Organize and control means of production
- Assign military forces abroad
- Institute martial law
- Seize and control all transportation and communication
- Regulate private enterprise
- Restrict travel

The National Emergencies Act (1976) attempted to limit these powers but allows declarations with just a presidential signature, renewable annually ad infinitum.

### Climate Disasters and Authoritarianism

Research shows natural disasters can help autocratic politicians consolidate power:

**Historical Example - Dominican Republic (1930s):**
- A hurricane hit less than a month into Rafael Trujillo's presidency
- He declared martial law and imposed "emergency taxes"
- Exploited the disaster to eliminate political opposition
- Built monuments in his own honor
- Turned his regime into one of the longest-lasting Central American dictatorships

> "Although it's difficult to prove that climate change contributed to the ascent of strongmen, political scientists, economists, and psychologists have found evidence that the dangers of global warming can push individuals, and nations, in an authoritarian direction." - Grist

### Risk of Abuse

Political economy research suggests disasters may allow governments to expand powers beyond saving lives:
- Curtail individual rights
- Censor criticism
- Consolidate power under emergency justification

## Eco-Fascism

### Definition

**Eco-fascism** is a synthesis of radical far-right politics with environmentalism. Scholar Alex Amend defines it as:

> "The devaluing of human life - particularly of populations seen as inferior - in order to protect the environment viewed as essential to White identity."

Key characteristics:
- Blends ethnonationalism with authoritarianism
- Rooted in belief that land and people form a symbiotic "organic whole"
- Draws on Nazi "blood and soil" (Blut und Boden) ideology
- Argues overpopulation (by non-white populations) is the primary environmental threat

### Lifeboat Ethics: Intellectual Foundation

**Garrett Hardin** (ecologist) developed the "lifeboat ethics" metaphor in 1974:

- Rich nations = lifeboats with limited capacity
- Poor nations = swimmers in the ocean
- Used to argue against foreign aid, immigration, and food banks
- Claimed unrestricted immigration leads to "total collapse of the whole system"

**Critique:** Hardin's ideas have been characterized as "more sinister than most of its detractors admit... a pernicious political doctrine based on a so-called ecological analysis. The ecological analysis is scientifically wrong, but ideologically consistent."

**Finnish eco-fascist Pentti Linkola** made explicit what Hardin implied:
> "What to do, when a ship carrying a hundred passengers suddenly capsizes and there is only one lifeboat? ... Those who love and respect life will take the ship's axe and sever the extra hands that cling to the sides."

### Modern Manifestations

#### Mass Shootings and Eco-Fascist Ideology

**Christchurch, New Zealand (March 15, 2019):**
- Brenton Tarrant murdered 51 people at two mosques
- Manifesto described himself as "Ethno-nationalist Eco-fascist"
- Section titled "Green nationalism is the only true nationalism"
- Claimed "overpopulation" by non-whites was the central cause of environmental degradation
- Argued climate change and immigration were "aspects of the same process"

**El Paso, Texas (August 3, 2019):**
- Patrick Crusius killed 23 people at Walmart
- Manifesto expressed support for Christchurch attack
- Also described himself as an "eco-fascist"
- Posted to 8chan citing "environmental destruction" concerns

**Buffalo, New York (2022):**
- Shooter hailed Christchurch attacker as inspiration
- Plagiarized manifesto section describing immigration as "environmental warfare"
- Embraced "eco-fascist" label

### Warning Signs

The far-right has attempted to appropriate environmental concerns to advance exclusionary and violent agendas. Key rhetoric includes:
- Blaming immigrants for environmental degradation
- Framing migration as "environmental warfare"
- Using population concerns as cover for racial exclusion
- Advocating "population control" targeting Global South

## Fossil Fuel Industry and Climate Denial

### ExxonMobil Knew: Timeline

#### 1977-1982: Internal Research Phase

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1977 | Senior scientist James Black reported to executives: "general scientific agreement" that burning fossil fuels influences climate |
| 1978 | Black warned that doubling CO2 would increase temperatures by 2-3C - consistent with today's scientific consensus |
| 1982 | Internal report to management warned consequences "could be catastrophic" and that effects "might not be reversible" |

#### Research Quality

A Harvard-led analysis published in *Science* found:
- 63-83% of ExxonMobil's internal warming projections were consistent with actual temperatures
- Average "skill score" of 72% (+/- 6%), with highest scoring 99%
- Internal projections surpassed some academic and governmental scientists in accuracy

#### From Knowledge to Denial (1989-Present)

- **1989:** Helped create Global Climate Coalition to question climate science
- **1998:** Helped prevent U.S. from signing Kyoto Protocol
- **2002:** Global Climate Coalition disbanded
- **2015:** InsideClimate News investigation revealed the full history (Pulitzer Prize finalist)
- Created the hashtag #ExxonKnew and spawned climate liability lawsuits

> "Whereas academic and government scientists worked to communicate what they knew to the public, ExxonMobil worked to deny it."

- [Greenpeace: Exxon's Climate Denial Timeline](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/climate/exxons-climate-denial-history-a-timeline/)

### The Koch Network

#### Funding Scale

- Koch Family Foundations spent **$145,555,197** directly financing 90 groups attacking climate science (1997-2018)
- From 2005-2011: Koch Foundations provided $43.1 million vs. ExxonMobil's $12.3 million to the same denial network
- 2005-2008: Koch brothers provided almost $25 million to climate denial groups - outspending ExxonMobil by a factor of three
- 2010: Greenpeace crowned Koch Industries "the kingpin of climate science denial"

#### The "Kochtopus" Network

The Koch network funds an infrastructure of "literally hundreds of organizations":

**Key Organizations Funded:**
- Cato Institute (co-founded by Koch brothers, 1977)
- Heritage Foundation
- Heartland Institute
- Reason Foundation
- Mercatus Center
- Foundation for Economic Freedom
- Independent Institute

#### Dark Money Infrastructure

**Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund:**
- Primary "identity-laundering shops" for climate denial funding
- Described as "central component" and "predominant funder" of denial apparatus
- Kochs funnel millions through the obscure Knowledge and Progress Fund

**Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce:**
- Dark money umbrella group
- Hidden hundreds of millions in politically-charged cash
- Shuffled between trusts, nonprofits, and LLCs

**Total Dark Money:** 140 foundations funneled $558 million to almost 100 climate denial organizations (2003-2010)

#### Political Impact

> "By 2014, only 8 of 278 Republicans in Congress were willing to acknowledge that man-made climate change was a reality. Today, none would. That pattern of denial has no counterpart elsewhere in the world - which makes sense, because no other nation yet has an apparatus like the Koch network in America."

## Climate Policy Rollbacks (2025)

### Paris Agreement Withdrawal (Second Time)

On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14162 "Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements":

- Directed U.S. withdrawal from Paris Climate Agreement
- Withdrawal takes effect January 27, 2026
- This was Trump's second withdrawal from Paris (first was in 2017, reversed by Biden in 2021)

### Beyond Paris: Exiting the UNFCCC

The Trump administration targeted the foundational climate treaty itself:

- Suspended U.S. support for 66 international bodies including:
  - **UNFCCC** (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, joined 1992)
  - **IPCC** (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)
- If completed, U.S. would be the **first country ever** to exit the UNFCCC
- Re-entry would require new two-thirds Senate vote

### EPA Regulatory Rollbacks

#### Endangerment Finding Attack

The 2009 EPA endangerment finding established the legal basis for all federal climate regulation. The Trump administration:

- Ordered EPA to review "legality and continuing applicability"
- March 2025: EPA announced plans to undo the finding
- June 2025: Proposed ending carbon regulation of power plants
- July 2025: Draft repeal of endangerment finding released
- September 2025: Announced plan to repeal GHG emissions reporting for major polluters

#### Specific Rollbacks

| Target | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Coal/gas power plant carbon rules | Proposed rescission |
| Biden-era vehicle climate standards | Draft repeal packaged with endangerment rollback |
| Methane rule for oil/gas development | Compliance requirements suspended |
| GHG emissions reporting | Proposed repeal |

### Energy Policy Changes

- **Wind moratorium:** Paused new leases and permits for onshore and offshore wind on federal lands
- **Climate finance:** Revoked U.S. International Climate Finance Plan
- **IRA/Infrastructure Act:** Directed agencies to pause fund disbursement from these climate-related laws

### Timeline for Permanent Changes

E&E News reports: "Trump gutted climate rules in 2025. He could make it permanent in 2026."

Expected early 2026:
- Final rescission for vehicle climate standards
- Final repeal of Biden-era power plant standards

## Climate and Inequality

### Environmental Racism

**Definition:** The systemic social, economic, and political structures that place disproportionate environmental health burdens on communities based on race and ethnicity.

#### Sacrifice Zones

"Sacrifice zones" are populated areas with high pollution due to nearby toxic industrial facilities. The health and safety of residents is effectively sacrificed for others' economic gain.

> "Global 'sacrifice zones' - regions rendered dangerous and even uninhabitable due to environmental degradation - are in effect, 'racial and ethnic sacrifice zones.'" - UN Special Rapporteur E. Tendayi Achiume

#### Key Statistics

- **Race is the #1 indicator** for toxic facility placement - even more than class
- More than **50%** of residents near hazardous waste are people of color
- Poor communities have **35% higher burden** from particulate matter
- African Americans have **54% higher health burden** than overall population
- At least **6.7 million Black people** live near oil refineries

#### Case Study: Cancer Alley

The stretch of Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge:
- Home to **150 petrochemical facilities**
- Nation's highest cancer rates
- Disproportionately African American communities
- Some parts have cancer risks **50 times the national average**
- Louisiana has the most toxic air in the nation

> "Thanks in part to these plants - often built near poor and Black towns without the political muscle to block them..."

### Global North vs. Global South

#### Historical Emissions Responsibility

| Region/Country | Share of Historical Emissions |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| United States | 20% of all historical emissions |
| Global North | ~50% of all emissions since Industrial Revolution |
| Global North (per capita adjusted) | 92% of excess emissions driving climate breakdown |
| Global North population | ~20% of world |
| Carbon budget consumption | 70% of historic carbon budget |

#### Climate Debt

- The Global North has an "incalculable climate debt" owed to the Global South
- UK's climate debt estimated at over 1 trillion pounds
- Climate finance is viewed as **reparations, not aid**
- From this perspective, payments are "long overdue"

#### Colonial Contribution

Under colonial rule:
- Colonies supplied raw materials to industrializing nations
- Many were forced to de-industrialize (e.g., India)
- When emissions during colonial rule are assigned to colonizing nations, UK's share doubles

#### Disproportionate Impact

- Global South suffers **>90% of climate breakdown costs**
- **98% of deaths** associated with climate breakdown are in the Global South
- Just 78 "carbon majors" caused over **70% of global CO2 emissions**
- 125 billionaires emit **393 million tons CO2 annually**

### UNFCCC Framework

The "common but differentiated responsibilities" principle acknowledges:
- Global North responsible for largest share of historical and current emissions
- Global North should lead reduction efforts
- 1997 Kyoto Protocol required 5.2% reduction below 1990 levels by 2012

## Climate and Collapse

### Historical Examples of Environmental Collapse

#### The Maya Collapse (7th-9th Century CE)

Drought was a contributing factor to the Classic Maya collapse:

- Seasonally resolved titanium records show the Terminal Classic Period collapse occurred during an extended dry period
- Punctuated by intense multiyear droughts centered at approximately **810, 860, and 910 CE**
- Century-scale rainfall decline strained resources
- Abrupt drought events exacerbated social stresses

**Key Lesson:**
> "Ecological crisis becomes civilizational collapse only when adaptation fails, whether due to political rigidity, elite competition, or cultural constraints."

#### The Roman Empire

Environmental historians have added climate volatility to explanations of Rome's decline:

- Tree-ring and ice core studies indicate cooling and climatic instability from 4th century CE
- "Late Antique Little Ice Age" plus volcanic eruptions in 530s-540s
- Precipitated crop failures, social unrest, and disease
- **Justinian Plague of 541 CE** emerged in this context

#### Other Collapsed Civilizations

| Civilization | Climate Factor |
|--------------|----------------|
| Khmer (Angkor) | Multi-decade droughts |
| Tiwanaku (Lake Titicaca) | Extended drought |
| Teotihuacan (Mexico) | Prolonged drought |
| Anasazi (American Southwest) | Megadrought |
| Greenland-Iceland Norse | Climate cooling |
| Easter Island | Resource depletion |

### Modern Civilizational Risk

A minority of climate scientists have argued that:
- Warming between **3C-5C** may be incompatible with civilization
- Billions of lives could no longer be sustained in such a world
- Understanding ancient responses to climate change provides lessons for the future

### Resilience Factors

What distinguished resilient systems was **not technological superiority** but:
- Social and political flexibility
- Ability to pivot, redistribute, and rethink priorities
- Cultural practices enabling adaptation

**Historical Adaptations:**
- Angkor Wat and Sri Lanka: Reservoirs and terraces
- Mayapan Maya: Incorporated drought-resistant indigenous plants into diet

The water protector movement arose from Indigenous communities during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at Standing Rock (2016):

> "Water protectors are distinguished from other environmental activists by a philosophy rooted in an indigenous cultural perspective that sees water and the land as sacred."

#### Standing Rock (2016)

- April 2016: Youth from Standing Rock organized "ReZpect Our Water" campaign
- LaDonna Brave Bull Allard established water protector camp
- **Thousands joined** from around the world
- **Over 200 tribes united** - had not gathered in such numbers for 150+ years

**Criminalization:**
- 800 criminal charges against water protectors
- TigerSwan, a private "mercenary" contractor, was hired to suppress protests
- Since Standing Rock, states have passed anti-protest laws targeting Indigenous-led movements

#### Continued Resistance

- Wet'suwet'en resistance to Coastal GasLink pipeline echoes Standing Rock
- August 2021 report: "Indigenous land defenders are the best defence against the climate crisis"

> "Whether by physically disrupting construction, legally challenging projects, or effecting procedural delays, Indigenous land defenders and Nations utilize a multi-tiered approach to resist fossil fuel projects."

#### Legal Infrastructure

The Water Protector Legal Collective grew out of Standing Rock resistance, providing legal support for Indigenous peoples and climate justice movements.

## Key Analytical Connections

### Climate-Authoritarianism Feedback Loops

1. **Climate disasters create emergency conditions** that autocrats exploit to consolidate power
2. **Resource scarcity intensifies conflicts** that states use to justify militarization
3. **Climate migration creates scapegoat populations** for nationalist movements
4. **Fossil fuel interests fund climate denial** which prevents democratic action on climate
5. **Policy rollbacks accelerate climate change** creating more disasters

### The Eco-Fascism Pipeline

```
Environmental concern + Scapegoating migrants + Lifeboat ethics
    = Eco-fascist ideology
    = "Overpopulation" framing
    = Violence against "outsiders"
```

### Climate Colonialism Pattern

```
Historical emissions (Global North)
    -> Current climate impacts (Global South)
    -> Climate migration (South to North)
    -> Border militarization (by North)
    -> Deaths and criminalization (of migrants)
```

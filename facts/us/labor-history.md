## Part 1: Early Labor in the 1800s

### The Factory System and Its Human Cost

The American Industrial Revolution transformed the nation from an agrarian society into an industrial powerhouse—built on the backs of exploited workers, including children as young as five years old.

#### Factory Conditions

Early American factories were death traps:

- **Working hours**: 12-16 hour days, 6-7 days per week
- **Wages**: Often $1-3 per week for adults; children earned 50 cents or less
- **Air quality**: Cotton mills filled with lint caused "brown lung" disease; match factories exposed workers to phosphorus, causing "phossy jaw" (necrosis of the jawbone)
- **Lighting**: Dim gas lighting caused eye strain and blindness
- **Temperature**: Summer heat in factories reached 100°F+; no ventilation
- **Safety**: Unguarded machinery mangled workers daily; severed fingers were so common they barely warranted mention
- **Fines**: Workers were fined for talking, singing, looking out windows, or being late

#### Child Labor: America's Shame

By 1900, an estimated **2 million children** worked in American industry:

- **Textile mills**: Children as young as 5-6 operated dangerous machinery. Their small fingers were "ideal" for threading bobbins and cleaning under moving parts
- **Coal mines**: "Breaker boys" as young as 8 sorted coal for 10 hours daily, breathing coal dust that destroyed their lungs
- **Glass factories**: Boys worked near furnaces at 3,000°F, often suffering severe burns
- **Canneries**: Children shucked oysters starting at 3 AM, their fingers bleeding from shells
- **Agriculture**: Entire families, including toddlers, worked fields from dawn to dusk

**Death and injury statistics were rarely kept for children.** Their deaths were considered acceptable losses. A Pennsylvania coal mine disaster might kill a dozen boys, recorded simply as "12 hands lost."

### The Lowell Mill Girls (1820s-1840s)

The Lowell textile mills in Massachusetts recruited young women from New England farms with promises of independence and education. The reality:

- **Work schedule**: 5 AM to 7 PM, with 30-minute meal breaks
- **Living conditions**: Six women to a room in company boarding houses, two to a bed
- **Wages**: $3.50 per week, minus $1.25 for board
- **Health consequences**: "The air of the mill is filled with cotton filaments and dust... the lungs become affected"

**The Turnouts (Strikes)**:

- **1834**: 800 women walked out when wages were cut 15%. They were replaced within days.
- **1836**: 1,500 women struck against increased boarding house fees. This strike also failed.

Despite failures, the Lowell women pioneered labor organizing:
- Published the *Lowell Offering* and later *Voice of Industry*
- Formed the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association (1845)
- Collected 10,000 signatures for a 10-hour day petition
- Testified before the Massachusetts legislature—the first workers ever to do so

The mills eventually turned to immigrant labor willing to work for less. By the 1850s, Irish women replaced Yankee farm girls. The pattern of replacing organized workers with more desperate populations would repeat throughout American history.

### Early Strikes and Organizing

#### The First American Strike (1768)

Journeymen tailors in New York walked out over wage cuts—the first recorded strike in American history.

#### Philadelphia Cordwainers Strike (1806)

Shoemakers struck for higher wages. The result: **the first labor conspiracy trial in America**. Eight workers were found guilty of "criminal conspiracy" for organizing. The precedent: workers combining for better wages was illegal.

#### New York Conspiracy Trials (1836)

Twenty-one journeymen tailors were convicted of conspiracy for striking. The judge declared: "In this favored land of law and liberty, the road to advancement is open to all... Every American knows that or ought to know that he has no better friend than the laws."

The "conspiracy doctrine" made organizing virtually illegal until 1842.

#### Commonwealth v. Hunt (1842)

The Massachusetts Supreme Court finally ruled that labor unions were not inherently criminal conspiracies. This didn't end persecution—it just required different tactics.

#### The Ten-Hour Movement

Throughout the 1830s-1840s, workers demanded a 10-hour day (down from 14-16 hours). Key moments:

- **1835**: Philadelphia general strike involving 20,000 workers won a 10-hour day for city workers
- **1840**: President Van Buren established a 10-hour day for federal employees
- **1847**: New Hampshire became the first state to legislate a 10-hour day (easily circumvented by employers)

#### The Molly Maguires (1870s)

In Pennsylvania's anthracite coal region, Irish miners formed a secret society to fight back against mine owners. They were accused of:
- Assassinating mine supervisors
- Destroying company property
- Intimidating workers who didn't join

**The response**: Franklin B. Gowen, president of the Reading Railroad, hired Pinkerton detective James McParlan to infiltrate the group. Based largely on McParlan's testimony, **20 Molly Maguires were hanged** between 1877-1879.

Many historians now believe at least some of the convicted were innocent, framed by the coal companies to destroy the nascent union movement. The real Molly Maguire organization may have been far more limited than prosecutors claimed—or may not have existed at all as described.

## Part 2: Gilded Age Warfare (1870-1900)

The "Gilded Age" saw the most violent labor conflict in American history. Workers faced not just company goons but state militias, federal troops, and private armies. **Thousands of workers were killed** in this period—exact numbers are unknown because many deaths were never officially recorded.

### The Great Railroad Strike of 1877

**The First National Strike in American History**

**Context**: The Panic of 1873 caused a severe depression. By 1877, railroad companies had cut wages 35% while maintaining dividend payments to shareholders. On July 16, 1877, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad announced another 10% wage cut.

**The Explosion**:
- **July 16**: Workers in Martinsburg, West Virginia refused to let trains move
- **July 17**: Governor called in militia; soldiers refused to fire on workers
- **July 18**: President Hayes sent federal troops—first use of federal military to break a strike

**The Spread**:
- **Baltimore**: July 20-21, militias fired into crowds. **At least 10 killed, dozens wounded**
- **Pittsburgh**: July 21-22, Philadelphia militia opened fire on a crowd of strikers and their families. **At least 20 killed, including women and children**. Workers burned the rail yards, 39 buildings, and 1,200 rail cars. The city was in worker control for days.
- **Reading, PA**: July 23, militia killed **10-13 workers**
- **Chicago**: July 25-26, police and federal troops battled crowds for two days. **At least 30 killed**
- **St. Louis**: Workers briefly established a general strike and quasi-government before federal troops arrived

**Total death toll: Estimates range from 100 to over 300 killed**, with many more wounded. The vast majority were workers and bystanders, not soldiers or police.

**Aftermath**:
- The strike was crushed within two weeks
- Federal armories were built in major cities—designed for urban warfare against workers, not foreign enemies
- States created permanent National Guard units specifically for strike-breaking
- Railroad companies created blacklists of strike participants

**The lesson learned by capital**: The military could be used against American workers. The lesson learned by workers: Organization must cross industry and regional lines.

### The Haymarket Affair (1886)

**The Fight for the Eight-Hour Day**

**Context**: The Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (predecessor to the AFL) called for a national general strike on May 1, 1886, demanding an eight-hour workday. The slogan: *"Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will."*

**May 1, 1886**: An estimated **300,000-500,000 workers struck nationwide**, with 40,000 in Chicago alone.

**May 3, 1886**: At the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company in Chicago, police fired into a crowd of striking workers, killing at least **2-4 workers** (sources vary).

**May 4, 1886 - The Haymarket Rally**:
- Anarchist leaders called a peaceful protest at Haymarket Square
- The crowd was small and peaceful; even Chicago Mayor Carter Harrison attended and left, telling police the meeting was "tame"
- As the meeting was ending, 180 police officers arrived and ordered the crowd to disperse
- Someone threw a bomb into police ranks
- Police opened fire—into the crowd and each other in the confusion
- **7 police officers died** (mostly from the bomb); **at least 4 civilians died** from police gunfire
- Dozens wounded on both sides

**The Trial**:
Eight anarchist leaders were arrested. **None were accused of throwing the bomb.** The prosecution admitted they didn't know who threw it. Instead, the eight were charged with conspiracy—their speeches had allegedly inspired the unknown bomber.

The judge allowed jurors who admitted prejudice against anarchists. The prosecutor told the jury: "Convict these men, make examples of them, hang them, and you save our institutions."

**The Verdict**:
- Seven sentenced to death
- One sentenced to 15 years imprisonment

**The Executions (November 11, 1887)**:
- **Albert Parsons** - labor organizer and newspaper editor
- **August Spies** - newspaper editor
- **George Engel** - printer
- **Adolph Fischer** - printer

Spies' last words: *"There will come a time when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today."*

- **Louis Lingg** - died by suicide in his cell the night before (a smuggled dynamite cap)
- **Samuel Fielden** and **Michael Schwab** - sentences commuted to life imprisonment
- **Oscar Neebe** - 15-year sentence

**The Pardons (1893)**:
Governor John Peter Altgeld pardoned the three surviving prisoners, declaring they had not received a fair trial and the evidence did not support conviction. His political career was destroyed as a result.

**Legacy**:
- **May Day (International Workers' Day)** was established in 1889 to commemorate the Haymarket martyrs—celebrated worldwide except in the United States
- The eight-hour day would not become standard for another 50 years
- The word "anarchist" became synonymous with terrorist in American discourse

### The Homestead Strike (1892)

**Steel Workers vs. Pinkertons**

**Context**: The Homestead Steel Works near Pittsburgh was one of the most profitable in the world. Andrew Carnegie had expressed sympathy for workers' rights in writings, but left operations to his manager, Henry Clay Frick, whose motto was "break the union."

**The Setup**:
- The Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers had a contract expiring June 30, 1892
- Frick demanded wage cuts of 22% and offered contract terms designed to be rejected
- When the union refused, Frick locked out all 3,800 workers (only 800 were union members)
- A three-mile fence topped with barbed wire was built around the plant, with platforms for armed guards
- Frick hired 300 Pinkerton agents to seize the plant

**July 6, 1892 - The Battle**:
- At 4 AM, two barges carrying Pinkertons approached via the Monongahela River
- Workers and townspeople, warned in advance, gathered on the shore
- When Pinkertons tried to land, gunfire erupted
- A 14-hour battle ensued
- Workers rolled a burning railroad car toward the barges
- Dynamite, oil, and even a small cannon were used against the Pinkertons
- **Dead: 3 Pinkertons, 7 workers; wounded: approximately 70 total**

The Pinkertons surrendered and were marched through town, beaten by the crowd.

**The Aftermath**:
- Pennsylvania's governor sent 8,500 National Guard troops to occupy Homestead
- The plant reopened with strikebreakers protected by soldiers
- On July 23, anarchist Alexander Berkman (who had no connection to the strike) attempted to assassinate Frick—he survived with wounds
- The strike collapsed in November after five months
- The union was destroyed; steelworkers would not organize again until the 1930s

**Carnegie's Response**: From his castle in Scotland, Carnegie wrote Frick expressing support while maintaining public distance. He later claimed regret but took no responsibility.

### The Pullman Strike (1894)

**A National Boycott Crushed by Federal Power**

**Context**: George Pullman built a company town outside Chicago where his workers lived in company houses, shopped at company stores, attended a company church, and were paid in company scrip. Rents were deducted from wages. When the 1893 depression hit:
- Pullman cut wages 25-40%
- Rents and store prices remained unchanged
- Some workers received paychecks of a few cents after deductions
- A committee of workers who complained was fired

**May 11, 1894**: Workers struck against the Pullman Palace Car Company.

**June 26, 1894**: The American Railway Union (ARU), led by Eugene V. Debs, voted to boycott all Pullman cars. Within days, 250,000 railroad workers in 27 states stopped handling Pullman cars, paralyzing rail traffic across the nation.

**The Federal Response**:
- Railroad companies attached mail cars to Pullman trains, then charged strikers with obstructing U.S. mail
- Attorney General Richard Olney (former railroad lawyer) obtained a federal injunction against the strike under the Sherman Antitrust Act—the first use of antitrust law against a union
- President Grover Cleveland sent **12,000 federal troops** over the objection of Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld

**The Violence**:
- Troops clashed with crowds in Chicago and other cities
- Rail yards were destroyed (likely by agents provocateurs according to some historians)
- **At least 30 workers killed**, scores wounded
- Over 700 arrested, including Debs

**The End**:
- The strike collapsed in August
- Debs was sentenced to six months in prison for violating the injunction
- The ARU was destroyed
- In prison, Debs read Marx and emerged a socialist

**Legacy**:
- Established the precedent of federal intervention against strikes
- The injunction became capital's favorite weapon against labor
- Debs would become the foremost socialist leader in American history, running for president five times (receiving nearly 1 million votes in 1912 and 1920—the latter while imprisoned for opposing WWI)

## Part 3: Progressive Era Violence (1900-1920)

The "Progressive Era" is often portrayed as a time of reform and uplift. For workers, it was a continuation of bloody class warfare.

### The Triangle Shirtwaist Fire (March 25, 1911)

**146 Dead, Mostly Young Immigrant Women**

**Context**: The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory occupied the top three floors of the Asch Building in Manhattan. Most workers were young Jewish and Italian immigrant women, ages 14-23. They worked 52+ hours per week for $6-7.

The owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, were known as the "Shirtwaist Kings." To prevent theft and unauthorized breaks, they locked the exit doors during work hours.

**The Fire**:
- At 4:40 PM, a fire started on the 8th floor, likely from a discarded cigarette
- Fire spread rapidly through fabric scraps and paper patterns
- The fire escape collapsed under the weight of fleeing workers
- Interior doors opened inward and were blocked by panicking workers—or locked
- The single exterior fire escape ended at the second floor
- Elevator operators made heroic trips until the heat warped the doors

**The Jumpers**:
Witnesses on the street watched young women appear at windows. Rather than burn, they jumped—sometimes holding hands, sometimes in flames. Bodies fell faster than fire nets could catch them. The nets tore. Bodies went through the sidewalk vault lights into the basement.

Reporter William Shepherd phoned in his story: *"I learned a new sound—a more horrible sound than description can picture. It was the thud of a speeding, living body on a stone sidewalk."*

**The Dead**:
- 146 workers (123 women and girls, 23 men)
- Ages ranged from 14 to 43
- Many bodies were so badly burned identification was impossible
- Seven bodies were never identified

**The Trial**:
Blanck and Harris were charged with manslaughter. Their lawyer argued they didn't know the doors were locked. The jury acquitted them after deliberating less than two hours.

In a civil suit, they were ordered to pay $75 per victim. Their insurance payout exceeded their liability by $60,000—they profited from the fire.

**The Aftermath**:
- Mass public outrage led to the creation of the Factory Investigating Commission
- Frances Perkins, a witness to the fire, became a leading reformer and later FDR's Secretary of Labor—the first woman in a presidential cabinet
- New York passed 36 safety laws, becoming a model for national reform
- But it took the deaths of 146 workers to force these changes

**The Names**:
Unlike most industrial "accidents," the names of the Triangle dead were recorded. The youngest victims:
- **Kate Leone, 14**
- **"Sara" Rosaria Maltese, 14**
- **Rosie Weiner, 14**

### The Ludlow Massacre (April 20, 1914)

**National Guard Kills 21, Including 11 Children**

**Context**: The Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&I), owned primarily by John D. Rockefeller Jr., dominated the southern Colorado coalfields. Miners lived in company towns where:
- Housing was deducted from wages
- Stores charged inflated prices
- Company scrip couldn't be spent elsewhere
- Armed guards patrolled the camps
- Union organizers were banned; miners could be fired for talking to one

In September 1913, the United Mine Workers called a strike demanding:
- Recognition of the union
- A 10% wage increase
- An eight-hour day
- Payment in legal tender
- The right to choose their own housing and doctors

**The Tent Colony**:
When strikers were evicted from company housing, they established tent colonies on nearby public land. The largest, at Ludlow, housed about 1,200 people—miners and their families.

The company hired the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency to harass the colonies. An armored car mounted with a machine gun, called the "Death Special," patrolled the area.

In October, the governor deployed the Colorado National Guard—whose wages were partially paid by the coal companies.

**April 20, 1914**:
The Guard and company militia attacked the Ludlow colony. The sequence of events is disputed, but the results are not:
- Guardsmen and company gunmen fired into the camp for hours
- Women and children took shelter in pits dug beneath their tents
- The tents were soaked with kerosene and set ablaze
- Families in the pits were burned alive or suffocated

**The Dead**:
- **19-21 people killed** (sources vary)
- **11 children** died in the pits, including:
  - **Elvira Valdez, 3 months**
  - **Frank Petrucci, 4 months**
  - **Lucy Costa, 4 years**
  - **Onafrio Costa, 6 years**
- **3 women**, including two mothers of the dead children
- **5 men**, including the leader of the colony, Louis Tikas, who was captured and shot in the back while being held prisoner

**The Ten-Day War**:
When news spread, miners across Colorado armed themselves. For ten days, open warfare raged across the coalfields. Mines were attacked, company buildings burned, and an estimated **50-200 people died** (precise figures unknown).

President Wilson sent federal troops to end the fighting. The strike continued until December 1914 but ultimately failed.

**The Aftermath**:
- A congressional investigation criticized the Guard but produced no indictments
- Not a single Guardsman or company agent was punished for the massacre
- John D. Rockefeller Jr. hired PR pioneer Ivy Lee to manage his image
- Rockefeller established the Colorado Industrial Plan, a "company union" designed to prevent real organizing

**Legacy**:
The Ludlow Massacre became a rallying cry for labor organizing. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about it. But it also demonstrated the limits of strike action against unlimited capital backed by state violence.

### The Everett Massacre (November 5, 1916)

**Free Speech Fight Turns Bloody**

**Context**: The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or "Wobblies") were organizing timber workers in the Pacific Northwest. When IWW organizers arrived in Everett, Washington, local authorities arrested them for speaking on public streets.

**The Free Speech Fight**:
Wobblies deliberately violated speaking ordinances to fill the jails and publicize their cause. Local vigilantes, organized by the sheriff, beat IWW members and drove them out of town. In one incident, 41 Wobblies were beaten with clubs and forced to run a gauntlet, then left in the wilderness.

**November 5, 1916**:
About 300 IWW members boarded two steamers in Seattle, headed for Everett. When the Verona reached the dock, Sheriff Donald McRae waited with 200 deputized vigilantes.

*"Who is your leader?"* McRae demanded.

*"We are all leaders,"* came the reply.

Gunfire erupted. Who fired first remains disputed. The shooting lasted about ten minutes.

**The Dead**:
- **At least 5 IWW members killed** (bodies seen falling into Puget Sound suggest more)
- **2 deputies killed**
- **50+ wounded**

**The Trial**:
74 IWW members were charged with murder. Thomas Tracy, tried first, was acquitted—evidence suggested deputies had shot each other in the crossfire. The remaining charges were dropped.

No deputy was ever charged.

### The Bisbee Deportation (July 12, 1917)

**2,000 Miners Kidnapped at Gunpoint**

**Context**: The Bisbee copper mines in Arizona were crucial to the war effort. When miners organized with the IWW and struck for better conditions, Phelps Dodge Corporation and local authorities decided on an extreme solution.

**July 12, 1917**:
At dawn, Phelps Dodge security, local police, and a deputized posse of 2,000 armed men rounded up striking miners and suspected sympathizers. Men were pulled from their homes at gunpoint. Over 2,000 people—including bystanders, small business owners, and a lawyer who protested—were herded to a baseball field.

**The Deportation**:
Armed guards marched 1,186 men to waiting cattle cars. For 16 hours, in the desert heat without food or water, they were transported 200 miles to Hermanas, New Mexico, and abandoned in the desert.

U.S. Army troops eventually provided food and shelter. The deportees were warned that returning to Bisbee would mean death.

**The Aftermath**:
- A presidential commission condemned the deportation as "wholly illegal"
- A federal grand jury indicted 21 Phelps Dodge officials and local leaders
- All charges were eventually dropped
- The Supreme Court ruled workers had no federal recourse for the kidnapping
- No one was ever punished

**Legacy**:
The Bisbee Deportation demonstrated that in wartime, corporations could commit mass kidnapping with impunity. The IWW, already under federal attack, was further devastated.

## Part 4: The 1920s-1930s

### The Battle of Blair Mountain (August 25 - September 2, 1921)

**The Largest Armed Uprising Since the Civil War**

**Context**: West Virginia's coal miners had been fighting a guerrilla war for union recognition since 1912. The Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency terrorized mining communities. On May 19, 1920, Baldwin-Felts agents attempted to evict miners from company housing in Matewan. A shootout left **10 dead**, including 7 detectives and the town's mayor. Police Chief Sid Hatfield was later assassinated by Baldwin-Felts agents on the courthouse steps in broad daylight.

**The March**:
In August 1921, miners heard that union organizers were being held in Logan County. An estimated **10,000-15,000 armed miners** assembled and began marching toward Logan. Many were WWI veterans who brought their military weapons. They wore red bandanas for identification—the origin of the term "redneck" as a labor symbol.

**The Battle**:
On August 25, the miners encountered a fortified line of company men, deputies, and state police along Blair Mountain. The battle lasted nearly a week:
- Machine gun nests defended the mountain
- Private planes (possibly Army, though officially denied) dropped bombs on the miners—the first aerial bombing of U.S. citizens on American soil
- **An estimated 50-100 miners were killed** (records are incomplete)
- About 30 defenders died

**The End**:
President Harding sent federal troops with orders to shoot. Most miners, unwilling to fire on the U.S. Army, surrendered or dispersed.

**The Aftermath**:
- 985 miners were indicted for murder, conspiracy, and treason against the state of West Virginia
- Most were acquitted or had charges dropped
- The United Mine Workers was devastated; membership dropped from 50,000 to 10,000 in West Virginia
- The union would not recover until the New Deal

**The Cover-Up**:
For decades, the Battle of Blair Mountain was barely mentioned in history books. The site was nearly destroyed by mountaintop removal mining before preservationists intervened. It became a National Historic Landmark in 2009—revoked in 2010 under pressure from coal companies, then restored again in 2018.

### Red Scare Deportations (1917-1920)

**The First "Red Scare"**

World War I and the Russian Revolution provided the pretext for a massive crackdown on labor and the left.

**The Targets**:
- IWW leaders were arrested en masse; 101 were convicted in a single mass trial
- Socialist Party leader Eugene Debs was imprisoned for a speech opposing the war
- Anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were deported to Russia
- Thousands of immigrants were rounded up in "Palmer Raids" conducted by Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer and his young aide, J. Edgar Hoover

**The Palmer Raids (1919-1920)**:
- November 7, 1919: Federal agents raided IWW and Communist Party offices in 12 cities, arresting thousands
- January 2, 1920: Raids in 33 cities resulted in over 4,000 arrests
- People were held without charge, denied lawyers, and beaten
- The "Soviet Ark" deported 249 people to Russia in December 1919

**Death toll**: Unknown. At least one deportee died on the journey. Others died in Soviet Russia. The psychological toll on thousands of families is incalculable.

**Legacy**:
- The IWW was effectively destroyed as a national organization
- The Socialist Party, which had received 900,000 votes in 1912, was shattered
- The precedent for political repression was established—Hoover would refine these techniques for decades

### The Ford Hunger March (March 7, 1932)

**Police and Ford Security Kill Unemployed Workers**

**Context**: The Great Depression devastated Detroit. Ford had laid off 75% of its workforce. On March 7, 1932, the Unemployed Councils organized a march to Ford's River Rouge plant demanding jobs and relief.

**The March**:
3,000-5,000 unemployed workers marched from Detroit to Dearborn (where Ford's plant was located). At the Dearborn city line:
- Police attacked with tear gas
- Marchers responded with rocks and frozen mud
- Fire hoses in freezing temperatures drenched the crowd
- Ford security chief Harry Bennett arrived and was struck by a rock
- Police and Ford security opened fire with pistols and a machine gun

**The Dead**:
- **4 workers killed** at the scene
- **1 more died later** of wounds
- **60+ wounded**, many by gunfire

**The Funeral**:
The funeral procession drew **30,000-80,000 mourners**—one of the largest in Detroit history. Marchers carried red banners and sang the Internationale. It was, effectively, a Communist demonstration—the Communist Party had organized the march.

**The Aftermath**:
- No police or Ford employees were charged
- The incident helped galvanize support for auto worker organizing
- Dearborn remained a "company town" that banned union activity for years

### The Memorial Day Massacre (May 30, 1937)

**Chicago Police Kill Steelworkers and Their Families**

**Context**: The Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) was attempting to organize "Little Steel" (Republic, Youngstown, Bethlehem, and Inland Steel) after U.S. Steel had signed a union contract. Republic Steel, led by notoriously anti-union Tom Girdler, refused to negotiate.

**May 30, 1937**:
Workers and their families—about 1,500 people—gathered for a Memorial Day rally and picnic near Republic Steel's South Chicago plant. They decided to march to the plant to establish a picket line.

About 500 marchers walked across a field toward the plant. Chicago police blocked their path. What happened next was captured on newsreel film that Paramount News initially refused to release, considering it too inflammatory.

**The Film Shows**:
- Police suddenly attack marchers with clubs
- Workers and families flee
- Police draw pistols and fire into the backs of fleeing people
- Police beat wounded people lying on the ground
- Cops laugh and joke as wounded workers lie bleeding

**The Dead**:
- **10 workers killed** (all shot in the back or side—none facing police)
- **30+ wounded by gunfire**
- **60+ beaten**

**The Victims**:
- **Alfred Causey**, 43, shot in the back
- **Earl Handley**, 37, shot twice in the back
- **Kenneth Reed**, 23, shot in the back, died June 4
- **Hilding Anderson**, 38, shot in the back
- **Joseph Rothmund**, 48, shot in the back
- **Lee Tisdale**, 51, shot in the back (African American)
- **Anthony Tagliori**, 26, shot in the back
- **Sam Popovich**, 55, shot in the back
- **Leon Francisco**, 17, shot in the back while running—the youngest victim
- **Otis Jones**, African American, shot while trying to carry another wounded man

**The Aftermath**:
- A coroner's jury ruled the killings "justifiable homicide"
- Not a single police officer was disciplined
- The Senate La Follette Civil Liberties Committee investigated and released the suppressed newsreel footage
- Republic Steel eventually signed with the union in 1942—it took WWII labor shortages to force recognition

**The Newsreel**:
Paramount's original decision to suppress the footage—on the grounds it would "incite riots"—demonstrates how media collaborated with capital. The footage was finally shown to Congress and slowly released to the public.

## Part 5: What Workers Won

The blood of workers bought the rights Americans now take for granted. Every item on this list required strikes, beatings, killings, and decades of struggle.

### The Eight-Hour Day

**Timeline to Victory**:
- **1791**: Philadelphia carpenters strike for 10-hour day—fail
- **1836**: Philadelphia general strike wins 10-hour day—for municipal workers only
- **1866**: National Labor Union demands 8-hour day
- **1886**: Haymarket Massacre during 8-hour movement
- **1898**: United Mine Workers win 8-hour day in coalfields
- **1914**: Ford introduces 8-hour day (and $5/day wage)—to reduce turnover and create consumers
- **1916**: Adamson Act establishes 8-hour day for railroad workers
- **1938**: Fair Labor Standards Act establishes 40-hour week with overtime pay

**Cost**: Uncounted thousands dead, wounded, imprisoned, and blacklisted over 147 years.

### End of Child Labor

**Timeline to Victory**:
- **1836**: Massachusetts requires children under 15 working in factories to attend school 3 months/year
- **1842**: Massachusetts limits children under 12 to 10 hours/day
- **1904**: National Child Labor Committee formed
- **1912**: Children's Bureau established
- **1916**: Keating-Owen Act bans interstate commerce in goods made with child labor—declared unconstitutional in 1918
- **1919**: Second child labor law passed—declared unconstitutional in 1922
- **1924**: Child Labor Amendment passes Congress—never ratified
- **1938**: Fair Labor Standards Act finally establishes federal child labor restrictions

**Cost**: Millions of children worked and died before reform came. The Supreme Court blocked reform for over 20 years.

### Workplace Safety

**Key Legislation**:
- **1970**: Occupational Safety and Health Act creates OSHA
- **1977**: Mine Safety and Health Act (after continued mining disasters)

**Before OSHA**:
- **14,000 workers died annually** in workplace accidents (likely an undercount)
- Over 2 million suffered disabling injuries

**After OSHA**:
- Workplace deaths dropped to about 5,000/year
- Injury rates fell dramatically

**Cost**: Triangle Fire, mining disasters, industrial accidents killing millions before government acted.

### Minimum Wage

**Timeline**:
- **1912**: Massachusetts establishes first state minimum wage—only for women and children
- **1923**: Supreme Court strikes down DC minimum wage law as unconstitutional
- **1938**: Fair Labor Standards Act establishes federal minimum wage of 25 cents/hour
- **1968**: Minimum wage reaches highest purchasing power: $1.60/hour ($12+ in 2023 dollars)
- **2009**: Last federal increase to $7.25/hour

**Cost**: Millions lived in poverty while courts protected "freedom of contract."

### Social Security

**1935**: Social Security Act signed by FDR

**What It Provided**:
- Old age pensions
- Unemployment insurance
- Aid to dependent children
- Aid to the blind and disabled

**What Was Excluded**:
- Agricultural workers (majority Black in the South)
- Domestic workers (majority Black women)

These exclusions were deliberate—Southern Democrats demanded them as the price for their votes. The racist structure of Social Security lasted for decades.

### The Right to Organize

**1935**: National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act)

**What It Guaranteed**:
- Workers' right to organize and join unions
- Workers' right to bargain collectively
- Workers' right to strike
- Prohibited employer interference with organizing
- Created the National Labor Relations Board

**For the First Time in American History**: Federal law protected workers' right to organize rather than criminalizing it.

**The Result**:
- Union membership exploded from 3.7 million in 1935 to 15 million in 1945
- The great industrial unions (auto, steel, rubber) were built
- Working-class living standards rose dramatically
- The "middle class" as we know it was created

## Part 6: What Was Lost

The gains of the 1930s-1960s have been systematically rolled back. Union membership has collapsed, and working-class power has declined to Gilded Age levels.

### The Taft-Hartley Act (1947)

**The "Slave Labor Act"**

Passed by a Republican Congress over Truman's veto, Taft-Hartley reversed key provisions of the Wagner Act:

**What It Did**:
- Banned "closed shops" (requiring union membership for hire)
- Allowed states to pass "right-to-work" laws
- Required union officers to sign affidavits declaring they were not Communists
- Banned sympathy strikes and secondary boycotts
- Allowed presidents to impose 80-day "cooling off" periods on strikes affecting national interest
- Gave employers "free speech" rights to campaign against unions

**The Effect**:
- Communist-led unions were expelled from the CIO
- Some of the most effective organizers were purged
- Union growth stalled
- The labor movement became defensive rather than expansionary

### Reagan Breaks PATCO (1981)

**The Signal to Corporate America**

On August 3, 1981, 13,000 members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) went on strike for better working conditions and pay.

**Reagan's Response**:
- Declared the strike illegal (federal workers couldn't legally strike)
- Gave strikers 48 hours to return to work
- Fired **11,345 workers** who didn't return
- Banned them from federal employment for life
- Decertified the union

**The Effect**:
- First time since the 19th century that the federal government openly crushed a union
- Signaled to private employers that union-busting was acceptable
- Strike activity collapsed: major strikes dropped from 300+/year in the 1970s to fewer than 20/year by the 2000s
- Replacement workers became standard operating procedure

### Union Membership Decline

**The Numbers**:
- **1954**: 35% of private-sector workers in unions
- **1983**: 20% in unions
- **2000**: 13% in unions
- **2022**: 6% of private-sector workers in unions

**The Causes**:
- Taft-Hartley restrictions
- Aggressive employer resistance
- Globalization and offshoring
- Deindustrialization
- "Right-to-work" laws
- NLRB weakened by anti-union appointments
- Rise of anti-union consulting industry ($340 million/year)

**The Correlation**:
As union membership has declined, inequality has skyrocketed. The share of income going to the top 10% has returned to 1920s levels.

### Right-to-Work Laws

Currently, **27 states** have "right-to-work" laws that prohibit union security agreements. The name is propaganda—these laws don't guarantee anyone a job.

**What They Actually Do**:
- Allow workers to benefit from union contracts without paying dues
- Create "free rider" problems that weaken unions
- Reduce union resources for organizing and representation

**The Effect**:
- Workers in right-to-work states earn approximately 3% less than comparable workers in other states
- Workplace safety is worse
- Union membership is significantly lower

**The History**:
The campaign for right-to-work laws was originally connected to segregation. Vance Muse, the Texas businessman who coined the term, said openly that without right-to-work laws, "white women and white men will be forced into organizations with black African apes."

### The Gig Economy

**The New Form of Exploitation**

Companies like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Amazon have created an army of workers classified as "independent contractors" who lack:
- Minimum wage protection
- Overtime pay
- Unemployment insurance
- Workers' compensation
- The right to organize
- Health benefits
- Job security

**The Numbers**:
- An estimated 55-70 million Americans do gig or contract work
- Many have no other employment options
- They bear all business risks while companies take the profits

**California's Prop 22 (2020)**:
When California passed a law (AB5) requiring gig companies to treat workers as employees, the companies spent **$200 million**—the most expensive ballot measure in U.S. history—to pass Prop 22, exempting themselves.

**The Pattern**: The same battles fought in the 1800s—for basic recognition as workers with rights—are being fought again.

## Part 7: Erased from History

### Why Labor History Isn't Taught

Most Americans graduate high school and college knowing nothing of the history outlined in this document. This is not an accident.

**What Textbooks Include**:
- The inventions of the Industrial Revolution
- The "captains of industry" (Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan)
- A brief mention of "unsafe working conditions" leading to reforms
- Perhaps a paragraph on the Triangle Fire

**What Textbooks Exclude**:
- The Haymarket martyrs
- The Ludlow Massacre (11 children burned alive)
- The Battle of Blair Mountain (Army bombs American workers)
- The Memorial Day Massacre (police shoot workers in the back)
- The thousands of workers killed in labor struggles
- The systematic use of state violence against workers
- The connection between worker organizing and everything we now take for granted

### Corporate Influence on Education

The exclusion of labor history is not mysterious. It serves clear class interests.

**Who Funds Education**:
- State legislatures dominated by business interests
- Corporate-funded foundations (Gates, Walton, Koch)
- Textbook publishers who avoid "controversial" content
- School boards often dominated by business owners

**The Self-Censorship**:
Teachers learn what's safe to teach. Labor history provokes complaints; the Gilded Age "robber barons" are rebranded as "captains of industry." Students learn that reforms happened because good people like Teddy Roosevelt wanted them—not because workers fought, bled, and died for them.

**The Effect**:
Workers don't know their own history. They don't know that the 8-hour day was paid for in blood. They don't know that the right to organize was won against machine guns and private armies. They accept the current erosion of labor rights as natural rather than as a return to the conditions their great-grandparents fought to escape.

### Labor Day vs. May Day

**May Day (May 1)**:
- Commemorates the Haymarket Affair and 8-hour day movement
- Celebrated as International Workers' Day in most of the world
- Features labor marches, demonstrations, strikes
- Explicitly political and class-conscious

**Labor Day (First Monday of September)**:
- Established in 1894 (days after federal troops crushed the Pullman Strike)
- Deliberately separated from May Day
- Features sales, barbecues, the "end of summer"
- Zero political content
- Workers don't think about labor; they think about hamburgers

**The Origin**:
President Cleveland supported Labor Day specifically to avoid May Day. A day honoring the Haymarket martyrs—executed by the American state—was unacceptable. A day of cookouts and sales was safe.

**The Result**:
Americans don't know that workers around the world commemorate American workers on May Day while Americans themselves have forgotten what May Day means.

## Conclusion: The Unfinished Fight

The labor movement did not win the fight. It won battles—important battles that created the modern middle class and established that workers have rights. But the war continues.

**What Workers Won**:
- The right to organize (weakened but not destroyed)
- The 8-hour day (eroding with salary exemptions and gig work)
- Workplace safety regulations (undermined by budget cuts and hostile administrators)
- A minimum wage (worth less than in 1968)
- Social Security and Medicare (constantly under attack)
- The end of child labor (except for "family farms" and migrant labor)

**What Workers Lost**:
- Union density (from 35% to 6% in private sector)
- The strike as an effective weapon
- Real wage growth (wages have stagnated since the 1970s)
- Job security
- Employer-provided benefits
- A voice in politics proportional to their numbers

**What Was Never Won**:
- Universal healthcare
- Guaranteed paid leave
- Child care
- A living wage
- An end to at-will employment
- Sectoral bargaining
- Real control over workplaces

**The Numbers**:
- Average CEO-to-worker pay ratio in 1965: 20 to 1
- Average CEO-to-worker pay ratio in 2021: 399 to 1
- Share of income going to the top 1% in 1970: 10%
- Share of income going to the top 1% in 2020: 20%

**The Lessons**:

1. **Nothing was given freely.** Every right workers have was taken through struggle. Capital has never voluntarily improved conditions.

2. **Violence has been overwhelmingly one-sided.** Workers have been shot, bombed, beaten, imprisoned, and killed in numbers that dwarf any violence committed by strikers.

3. **The state has primarily served capital.** Federal troops, state militia, local police, and courts have consistently sided with employers against workers.

4. **Gains can be lost.** The rights won between 1935-1970 have been systematically rolled back. There is no permanent victory.

5. **History is a weapon.** The erasure of labor history serves class interests. Workers who don't know their history can't learn from it.

6. **Solidarity is the only weapon workers have.** Individually, workers are powerless against organized capital. Collectively, they have won everything they have.

*"The only thing workers have to bargain with is their skill or their labor. Denied the right to withhold it as a last resort, they become powerless. The strike is therefore not a mere accident of industrial warfare—it is the weapon which makes industrial warfare possible."* — Walter Reuther

*"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will."* — Frederick Douglass

*"If the workers are organized, all they have to do is to put their hands in their pockets and they have got the capitalist class whipped."* — Big Bill Haywood

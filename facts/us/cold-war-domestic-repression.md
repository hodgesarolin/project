## Overview

This document examines the Cold War era in US history, focusing on both foreign policy interventions and domestic repression. The period saw the United States establish itself as a global superpower while simultaneously suppressing dissent at home through programs like COINTELPRO. Key themes include anti-communist hysteria, covert CIA operations, the Vietnam War, and the violent suppression of civil rights and leftist movements.

## 1. The Second Red Scare & McCarthyism (1947-1957)

### Origins and Context

**Fact:** The Second Red Scare emerged from the conflict between social conservatives and New Deal progressives, intensified by the onset of the Cold War. The period was marked by an unprecedented degree of political hysteria targeting suspected Communist sympathizers.

**Fact:** Senator Joseph McCarthy rose to prominence on February 9, 1950, when he claimed to have a list of 205 known Communists working in the State Department. The number changed multiple times in subsequent speeches.

**Fact:** As book bans, loyalty oaths, and blacklists became the norm, the House Un-American Activities Committee and later Senator McCarthy barreled through congressional hearings, seeking to sweep up any suspected Soviet sympathizers.

### House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)

**Fact:** In 1947 the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) began its investigation into Hollywood. Of the individuals subpoenaed by the committee that year, 10 refused to testify.

**Fact:** Referred to as the Hollywood Ten, they were indicted for contempt of Congress and sentenced to brief imprisonment.

**Fact:** In November 1947, film executives and producers issued the Waldorf Statement, declaring they would not hire any member of the Hollywood Ten unless acquitted or they declared under oath not being a Communist.

**Fact:** More than 300 actors, authors, and directors were denied work in the U.S. through the unofficial Hollywood blacklist. Blacklists were at work throughout the entertainment industry, in universities and schools at all levels, in the legal profession, and in many other fields.

### Loyalty Oaths and Institutional Purges

**Fact:** Loyalty oaths were required for employment across multiple sectors - not only in the federal government but at state and local levels, even at local hardware stores and real estate offices.

**Fact:** CBS instituted a loyalty oath which it required of all its employees.

**Fact:** The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) voted to make its officers swear a loyalty pledge asserting each was not a Communist.

**Fact:** Hundreds of teachers and librarians were hounded out of their professions for refusing to sign loyalty oaths.

### Destroyed Lives and Careers

**Fact:** Hollywood Ten member Albert Maltz faced prison time following his testimony that landed him on the blacklist. Maltz's career never recovered.

**Fact:** Adversaries of HUAC such as lawyer Bartley Crum - who defended Hollywood Ten members in front of the committee - were themselves branded as Communist sympathizers. The FBI tapped Crum's phones, opened his mail, and placed him under continuous surveillance. As a consequence, he lost most of his clients and, unable to cope with the stress of ceaseless harassment, committed suicide in 1959.

**Fact:** "Hundreds of New York City teachers were fired, suspended or punished because in the 1930s they affiliated with something that was considered too far to the left."

**Fact:** Thousands of innocent Americans would see their lives upended by the politically motivated witch hunt between roughly 1947 and 1954.

### End of the Blacklist

**Fact:** In 1960, Dalton Trumbo, one of the best known members of the Hollywood Ten, was publicly credited with writing the films Exodus and Spartacus, when actor and producer Kirk Douglas gave him screenwriting credit - marking the beginning of the end of the Hollywood blacklist.

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** The McCarthy era established a security apparatus, portions of which still exist today. The political divisions created during this period continue to influence American politics. McCarthyism demonstrates how fear of foreign ideologies was weaponized to suppress domestic dissent. While presented as anti-Communist security measures, the investigations targeted labor organizers, civil rights activists, and anyone challenging the status quo.

## 2. COINTELPRO (1956-1971)

### Program Overview

**Fact:** COINTELPRO (a syllabic abbreviation derived from Counter Intelligence Program) was a series of covert and illegal projects conducted between 1956 and 1971 by the FBI aimed at surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting, and disrupting American political parties and organizations that the FBI perceived as subversive.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO)

### Target Groups

**Fact:** Groups and individuals targeted by the FBI included:
- Communist Party USA
- Anti-Vietnam War organizers
- Activists in the civil rights and Black power movements (Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Black Panther Party)
- Student organizations such as Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)
- Feminist organizations
- American Indian Movement (AIM)
- Chicano and Mexican-American groups like the Brown Berets and United Farm Workers
- Independence movements

**Source:** [Britannica - COINTELPRO](https://www.britannica.com/topic/COINTELPRO)

### FBI Tactics (Declassified Documents)

**Fact:** Under FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, COINTELPRO tactics included:
- Intense surveillance
- Organizational infiltration
- Anonymous mailings
- Police harassment
- Legal harassment and intimidation
- Wiretapping
- Smear campaigns and blackmail
- Direct involvement in assassinations (Fred Hampton and others)

**Fact:** In letter-writing campaigns (wherein false letters were sent on behalf of members of parties), the FBI ensured that groups would not unite in their causes. They launched a campaign specifically to alienate the Black Panther Party from the Mau Maus, Young Lords, Young Patriots and SDS.

**Source:** [Rethinking Schools - COINTELPRO: Teaching the FBI's War on the Black Freedom Movement](https://rethinkingschools.org/articles/cointelpro-teaching-the-fbi-s-war-on-the-black-freedom-movement/)

### The Black Panther Party as Primary Target

**Fact:** One of the primary targets for COINTELPRO's operations was the Black Panther Party, the revolutionary Black rights group founded in Oakland in 1966. Just two years later, Hoover called the Panthers "the greatest threat to the internal security of the country."

**Fact:** FBI documents show that when conflict arose between the Black Panther Party and the US Organization, another Black Power group, FBI officials directed field offices to "exploit all avenues of creating further dissension" and to submit regular reports on "imaginative and hard-hitting counterintelligence measures aimed at crippling the BPP."

### How COINTELPRO Was Exposed

**Fact:** On March 8, 1971, the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI burglarized an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, stole more than 1,000 classified documents, and then released them to the press.

**Fact:** The Citizens' Commission members involved in the break-in were never caught nor revealed their names until 2014. In 2015, a documentary film, "1971," was released on the case.

**Fact:** More information regarding COINTELPRO was later obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, lawsuits lodged against the FBI by the Black Panther Party and the Socialist Workers Party, and statements by agents who came forward.

**Source:** [Zinn Education Project - March 8, 1971: FBI's COINTELPRO Exposed](https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/cointelpro-exposed/)

### FBI Surveillance of Civil Rights Movement

**Fact:** UC Berkeley Library's collection contains not only the COINTELPRO records, but also the surveillance files of many important Black figures and organizations of the day - including Thurgood Marshall, Marcus Garvey, the NAACP, Martin Luther King Jr., and SNCC.

**Source:** [UC Berkeley Library](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/about/news/fbi)

### Legacy and Ongoing Concerns

**Fact:** In April 2018, the Atlanta Black Star characterized the FBI as still engaging in COINTELPRO behavior by surveilling the Black Lives Matter movement. Internal documents dated as late as 2017 showed that the FBI had surveilled the movement using tactics "reminiscent of a rich American history of targeting black Americans."

**Source:** [Wikipedia - COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** COINTELPRO reveals that the US government engaged in systematic, illegal suppression of political dissent during the Civil Rights era. The program's existence contradicts the narrative of orderly democratic progress during this period. Many COINTELPRO tactics were later adopted by local police departments and elements continue in contemporary surveillance.

## 3. The Korean War (1950-1953)

### Death Toll

**Fact:** The Korean War was among the most destructive conflicts of the modern era, with approximately 3 million killed, most of whom were civilians.

**Fact:** General Curtis LeMay stated in a 1988 interview that about 20% of North Korea's population had died during the war.

**Fact:** LeMay said: "We went over there and fought the war and eventually burned down every town in North Korea anyway, some way or another... Over a period of three years or so, we killed off, what, 20 percent of the population?"

**Fact:** According to Robert Neer's 2013 book "Napalm," General LeMay wrote: "We killed off over a million civilian Koreans and drove several million more from their homes."

**Fact:** Historian Charles K. Armstrong estimated that 12%-15% of the North Korean population (about 10 million at the time) was killed in the war - approximately 1.2 million to 1.5 million people.

**Source:** [NukeWatch - "We Burned Down Every Town in North Korea"](https://nukewatchinfo.org/we-burned-down-every-town-in-north-korea/)

### The Bombing Campaign

**Fact:** The United States dropped a total of 635,000 tons of bombs, including 32,557 tons of napalm, on Korea - more than during the entire Pacific War (503,000 tons).

**Fact:** North Korea became among the most heavily bombed countries in history.

**Fact:** On an "average good day," pilots in the Korean War reportedly "dropped 70,000 gallons of napalm."

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Bombing of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_North_Korea)

### Physical Destruction

**Fact:** Whereas 60 Japanese cities were destroyed to an average of 43% in World War II, estimates of the destruction of towns and cities in North Korea "ranged from forty to ninety percent"; at least 50% of 18 out of 22 of North Korea's major cities were obliterated.

**Fact:** According to Neer, "Pyongyang, a city of half a million people before 1950, was said to have had only two buildings left intact."

**Fact:** The bombing campaign destroyed almost every substantial building in North Korea. The war's highest-ranking U.S. POW, Major General William F. Dean, reported that the majority of North Korean cities and villages he saw were either rubble or snow-covered wasteland.

**Fact:** North Korean factories, schools, hospitals, and government offices were forced to move underground.

**Source:** [Irish Times - Unknown to most Americans, the US 'totally destroyed' North Korea once before](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/unknown-to-most-americans-the-us-totally-destroyed-north-korea-once-before-1.3227633)

### Dam Attacks and Starvation Threat

**Fact:** The flood from the destruction of the Toksan dam "scooped clean" 27 miles of river valley. The attacks were followed by the bombing of the Kuwonga, Namsi, and Taechon Dams.

**Fact:** The bombing of these five dams and ensuing floods threatened several million North Koreans with starvation, with only emergency assistance from China, the USSR, and other socialist countries preventing widespread famine.

## 4. Vietnam War (1954-1975)

### The Gulf of Tonkin Lie

**Fact:** The Gulf of Tonkin incident refers to naval confrontations in August 1964. On August 2, there was a clash between a U.S. Navy destroyer collecting signals intelligence and three North Vietnamese vessels. On the night of August 4, two U.S. destroyers reported being attacked and returning fire.

**Fact:** Later investigation revealed that the August 4 attack did not happen; no North Vietnamese vessels had been present.

**Fact:** Shortly after the events, the National Security Agency deliberately skewed intelligence to create the impression that an attack had been carried out.

**Fact:** According to declassified NSA documents, analysts made "SIGINT fit the claim" of a North Vietnamese attack, with Tonkin Gulf intelligence being "skewed."

**Source:** [NSA Declassified - Gulf of Tonkin](https://www.nsa.gov/Helpful-Links/NSA-FOIA/Declassification-Transparency-Initiatives/Historical-Releases/Gulf-of-Tonkin/)

### NSA Document Declassification

**Fact:** In the early 2000s, nearly 200 documents were declassified and released by the NSA showing that there was no attack on August 4.

**Fact:** One of the most important documents released in 2005 was a study by NSA historian Robert J. Hanyok. He concluded that while there was an attack on August 2, nothing malicious happened on August 4. Additionally, he concluded that many pieces of evidence were carefully picked to distort the truth.

**Fact:** What should have stood out to the U.S. leadership was that no SIGINT "chatter" was detected during the alleged attacks on August 4. In contrast, during the August 2 attack, NSA listening posts monitored VHF communications between North Vietnamese vessels, HF communications between higher headquarters in Hanoi and the boats, and communication relays to the regional naval station. None of these communications occurred on August 4.

### Consequences

**Fact:** After the reported second attack, the U.S. Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution almost unanimously, allowing the federal government to "take all necessary measures" to protect U.S. forces in Vietnam. It was tantamount to a declaration of war, but it was based on a lie.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - William Calley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Calley)

### The Cover-Up

**Fact:** The events in My Lai were initially covered up by the U.S. Army.

**Fact:** In April 1969, nearly 13 months after the massacre, Ron Ridenhour, a GI who had been with the 11th Brigade, wrote letters to the President, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and 30 members of Congress.

**Fact:** The full dimensions of the massacre became public knowledge in mid-November 1969, when newspapers carried Seymour Hersh's interviews with men from Company C, the CBS Evening News broadcast other interviews, and photographs of the massacred victims were printed in Life magazine.

**Source:** [Famous Trials - The My Lai Massacre and Courts-Martial](https://famous-trials.com/mylaicourts/1656-myl-intro)

### Hero Who Stopped the Massacre

**Fact:** The My Lai massacre reportedly ended only after Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson, an Army helicopter pilot on a reconnaissance mission, landed his aircraft between the soldiers and the retreating villagers and threatened to open fire if they continued their attacks.

**Fact:** Thompson had nine civilians, including five children, flown to the nearest army hospital. Later, he rescued a baby still clinging to her dead mother.

## 5. CIA Coups and Regime Change Operations

### Iran (1953) - Operation Ajax

**Fact:** The Central Intelligence Agency was behind the overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953. Operation Ajax (TPAJAX) was the first covert regime-change operation carried out by the CIA, then only six years old.

**Fact:** After less than a week in office, on May 1, 1951, Mossadegh decided to nationalize the British-run Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.

**Fact:** Known as Operation Ajax, the CIA plot was ultimately about oil. The British emphasized to the new president that Mossadegh was a communist and that Iran falling under Soviet influence would be a catastrophic loss in the nascent Cold War.

### CIA Tactics in Iran

**Fact:** According to the CIA's declassified documents, some of the most feared mobsters in Tehran were hired by the CIA to stage pro-shah riots on August 19. Other men paid by the CIA were brought into Tehran in buses and trucks and took over the streets of the city.

**Fact:** Young CIA agents used suitcases full of cash to destabilize the regime. "They managed to buy newspaper editors, to buy hoodlums, they organized rallies in different cities, they created a fake communist party in order to create trouble."

**Fact:** Iranian operatives pretending to be Communists threatened Muslim leaders with "savage punishment if they opposed Mossadegh," seeking to stir anti-Communist sentiment in the religious community. The house of at least one prominent Muslim was bombed by CIA agents posing as Communists.

**Source:** [National Security Archive - The Secret CIA History of the Iran Coup, 1953](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB28/)

### Execution and Aftermath

**Fact:** The operation was led by senior CIA officer Kermit Roosevelt Jr., grandson of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt.

**Fact:** After Mossadegh and his allies thwarted the first coup attempt on August 15, 1953, officials in Washington wanted to pull the plug on the operation.

**Fact:** On August 19, 1953, the coup succeeded as the CIA and British intelligence helped pull pro-Shah forces together and organized large protests against Mossadegh.

**Fact:** Between 200 and 300 people were killed because of the conflict. Mossadegh was arrested, tried, convicted of treason, and sentenced to three years in jail, then placed under house arrest for the remainder of his life.

**Fact:** The coup "fanned the flames of anti-Western sentiment" which reached a crescendo in 1979 with the U.S. hostage crisis and the creation of the Islamic Republic.

**Fact:** The CIA's overthrow of Mossadegh was a template for the agency's covert operations going forward, serving as the model for future Cold War covert operations worldwide.

### Other CIA Coups and Interventions

**Congo (1960-1965):**

**Fact:** On August 27, 1960, Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles cabled the Leopoldville Station Chief that there was agreement in "high quarters" that Lumumba's removal must be an urgent and prime objective.

**Fact:** The CIA station chief in Congo, Larry Devlin, was told to inject poison in Lumumba's food or toothpaste.

**Fact:** The poisoning plot fizzled because Lumumba was ousted in a CIA-backed coup led by military officer Joseph Mobutu on September 14, 1960.

**Fact:** Lumumba was killed on January 17, 1961, at the age of thirty-five.

**Fact:** The CIA supported Mobutu with money, warning of assassination plots, and recommendations for ministerial appointments - and ultimately counseled Mobutu to reject reconciliation with Lumumba and arrest him and his associates instead.

**Fact:** Mobutu went on to rule the Congo for more than three decades.

**Indonesia (1965):**

**Fact:** The September 30th Movement accounted for the kidnapping and murder of six high-ranking Indonesian Army generals.

**Fact:** As a result, the Indonesian Army and its paramilitary allies launched a campaign of total annihilation against the PKI (Communist Party) and its allies. This caused up to 500,000 PKI supporters to be killed between October 1965 and March 1966.

**Fact:** Greg Poulgrain's research argues the coup was "the culmination of a covert CIA strategy to protect U.S. corporate interests in Southeast Asia."

## 6. Operation Condor (1975-1983)

### Overview

**Fact:** Operation Condor was a campaign of political repression by the right-wing dictatorships of the Southern Cone of South America, involving intelligence operations, coups, and assassinations of left-wing sympathizers.

**Fact:** It formally existed from 1975 to 1983, created in November 1975 when Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet's spy chief, Manuel Contreras, invited 50 intelligence officers from Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay to the Army War Academy in Santiago, Chile.

**Fact:** The operation was backed by the United States, which financed the covert operations.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Operation Condor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor)

### U.S. Involvement

**Fact:** The U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), the U.S. Special Forces, and the Army School of the Americas (SOA) were all involved in helping run Operation Condor.

**Fact:** A 1976 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report wrote that a Condor assassination unit was "structured much like a U.S. Special Forces Team."

**Source:** [National Security Archive - Operation Condor: A Network of Transnational Repression 50 Years Later](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/southern-cone/2025-11-26/operation-condor-network-transnational-repression-50-years)

### Assassination Squads (Declassified Documents)

**Fact:** According to a memo to the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, CIA Chief of the Latin America Division raised concerns that the "Condor" countries were organizing assassination squads with the specific purpose "to liquidate key Latin American terrorist leaders" outside the Southern Cone region.

**Fact:** The CIA obtained the "Teseo" agreement - a document that bureaucratically records the procedures, budgets, working hours, and operational rules for selecting, organizing and dispatching death squads.

**Fact:** Expenses for agents on assassination missions abroad were estimated at $3,500 per person for ten days, "with an additional $1000 first time out for clothing allowance."

**Source:** [National Security Archive - Operation Condor: Trove of Declassified Documentation](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB514/)

### Henry Kissinger's Role

**Fact:** Declassified records show that Kissinger was briefed on Condor and its "murder operations" on August 5, 1976.

**Fact:** During a June 1976 OAS meeting in Santiago, Chile, Kissinger met privately with Admiral Cesar Guzzetti, foreign minister of Argentina's military regime. Declassified documents reveal that Kissinger "not only encouraged the ongoing internal repression in Argentina, but also endorsed the 'joint efforts' with other Southern Cone regimes to address 'the terrorist problem.'"

**Source:** [National Security Archive - Operation Condor on Trial](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB416/)

### The Cancelled Warning

**Fact:** A State Department action cable signed by Kissinger initially instructed ambassadors to deliver a demarche warning Condor states that the U.S. had learned Operation Condor "may include plans for the assassination of subversives, politicians and prominent figures both within the national borders of certain Southern Cone countries and abroad."

**Fact:** However, Kissinger then instructed "that no further action be taken on this matter," effectively ending the State Department initiative to warn the Condor military regimes not to proceed with international assassination operations.

**Fact:** Patricia M. Derian, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs from 1977 to 1981, said of Kissinger's role: "It sickened me that with an imperial wave of his hand, an American could sentence people to death."

**Source:** [Progressive.org - Kissinger and Chile: A Declassified Postmortem](https://progressive.org/latest/kissinger-and-chile-a-declassified-postmortem-kornbluh-20231209/)

### Notable Assassinations

**Fact:** The car-bomb assassination on Embassy Row on September 21, 1976 was the most visible Condor operation. Orlando Letelier, a Chilean citizen and vocal opponent of the Pinochet regime, and his American colleague Ronni Moffitt, were both killed in Washington, D.C.

**Source:** [National Security Archive - Operation Condor Verdict: GUILTY!](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/southern-cone/2016-05-27/operation-condor-verdict-guilty)

### Declassification

**Fact:** In June 1999, by order of President Bill Clinton, the State Department released thousands of declassified documents revealing for the first time that the CIA and the State and Defense Departments were "intimately aware of Condor."

**Fact:** The first declassified CIA document to name "CONDOR" as a "cooperative arrangement" against subversion was dated June 25, 1976.

**Source:** [Al Jazeera - Operation Condor: Setting precedent from one 'war on terrorism' to the next](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2013/9/29/operation-condor-setting-precedent-from-one-war-on-terrorism-to-the-next)

## 7. The Civil Rights Movement - Beyond the Standard Narrative

### Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)

**Fact:** The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) was founded in April 1960 at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, in the wake of student-led sit-ins at segregated lunch counters across the South.

**Fact:** Ella Baker, executive secretary of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), recommended that the group keep its autonomy and not affiliate with the SCLC or other civil rights groups.

**Fact:** "With its radical ideology and effective tactics, SNCC was the cutting edge of the civil rights movement during the 1960s."

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee)

### Transition to Black Power

**Fact:** In May 1966, Stokely Carmichael replaced John Lewis as chairman of SNCC, a move that signaled a shift in the student movement "from an emphasis on nonviolence and integration toward black militancy."

**Fact:** Carmichael's use of the phrase "Black Power" during the March Against Fear in Mississippi in June 1966 "marked SNCC's transition to a focus on Black self-reliance and the plight of low-income Black people living in urban centers."

**Fact:** Despite his firing of the Atlanta Project staff, Carmichael came to embrace racial separatism, eject SNCC's white members, and issue a call for Black Power, which emphasized racial dignity, Black self-reliance, and the use of violence as a legitimate means of self-defense.

**Source:** [Stanford King Institute - Carmichael, Stokely](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/carmichael-stokely)

### Alliance with Black Panther Party and Decline

**Fact:** Under Carmichael's successor, H. Rap Brown, SNCC increasingly collaborated with the Black Panther Party.

**Fact:** In 1968, Brown changed SNCC's name, substituting "national" for "nonviolent."

**Fact:** In July 1967, with the expulsion of white members, SNCC's annual income decreased dramatically. In 1970, SNCC lost all 130 employees and the majority of their branches. By 1973, SNCC no longer existed.

**Source:** [National Archives - The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)](https://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/black-power/sncc)

### Legacy

**Fact:** Members of SNCC included prominent future leaders such as former Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, Congressman John Lewis, and NAACP chairman Julian Bond.

## 8. MLK's Radical Politics

### Anti-Capitalism

**Fact:** When King was assassinated in 1968, he was in the midst of waging a radical campaign against economic inequality and poverty, while protesting vigorously against the Vietnam War.

**Fact:** In the summer of 1952, he wrote a letter to Coretta Scott in which he concluded that "capitalism has outlived its usefulness," stating he was "much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic."

**Fact:** In 1966, King told staff at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference that "there must be a better distribution of wealth and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism."

**Fact:** On March 30, 1967, King told the SCLC board: "The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and racism. The problems of racial injustice and economic injustice cannot be solved without a radical redistribution of political and economic power."

**Source:** [The Intercept - Martin Luther King Jr. Celebrations Overlook His Critiques of Capitalism](https://theintercept.com/2016/01/18/martin-luther-king-jr-celebrations-overlook-his-critiques-of-capitalism-and-militarism/)

### Anti-War Stance

**Fact:** His radical turn was creating tensions among his supporters, and in 1966, long before anti-war sentiment was widely popular, he spoke out against the Vietnam War. Liberal newspapers that had hailed him as a hero now attacked him.

**Fact:** A Harris poll conducted after King's Vietnam speech found that only 25 percent of African Americans supported him in his antiwar turn, and only 9 percent of the public at large agreed with his objections to the war.

**Fact:** King masterfully tore down the wall that the political and economic establishments used to separate domestic policies from foreign policies. He debunked the lie that the Johnson administration could deliver both guns and butter.

**Source:** [Common Dreams - Progressives Remember the 'Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Imperialist' MLK](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/01/20/countering-annual-whitewash-his-legacy-progressives-remember-anti-capitalist-anti)

### The Poor People's Campaign (1968)

**Fact:** The Poor People's Campaign was a 1968 effort to gain economic justice for poor people in the United States, organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and the SCLC.

**Fact:** The campaign demanded economic and human rights for poor Americans of diverse backgrounds, with participants setting up a 3,000-person protest camp on the Washington Mall for six weeks.

**Fact:** King's growing disillusionment with the possibility of reform caused him to question the nature of racism. He concluded that the capitalist economy was responsible for poverty and division, and dedicated himself to building a Poor People's Campaign to challenge it.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Poor People's Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_People%27s_Campaign)

### King's Evolution

**Fact:** King said: "For years I labored with the idea of reforming the existing institutions of society through a little change here and little change there... but now I feel quite differently. You have got to have a reconstruction of the whole society, a revolution of values... Power must be relocated, a radical redistribution of power must take place."

**Source:** [City Heights CDC - 5 MLK Quotes Too Radical To White-Wash](https://www.cityheightscdc.org/stories/mlk-quotes-too-radical-to-be-white-washed)

### The "Three Evils"

**Fact:** In a posthumously published essay, King wrote: "The black revolution... is forcing America to face all of its interrelated flaws - racism, poverty, militarism and materialism. It is exposing the evils that are rooted deeply in the whole structure of our society. It reveals systemic rather than superficial flaws and suggests that radical reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced."

**Source:** [Socialist Worker - Reclaim Martin Luther King the radical](https://socialistworker.co.uk/in-depth/reclaim-martin-luther-king-the-radical/)

### Government Response

**Fact:** Government officials tracked his growing radicalism and feared it. "King is so hot these days that it looks like Marx coming to the White House," complained President John F. Kennedy in 1963. He authorized his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, to wiretap King and his associates.

**Fact:** The FBI had labeled King "The most dangerous Negro of the future in this nation."

**Source:** [Harvard Political Review - The FBI Killing of Fred Hampton](https://harvardpolitics.com/fred-hampton-assassination/)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** King's assassination in Memphis on April 4, 1968, came as he was organizing the Poor People's Campaign - a direct challenge to economic inequality. His radical anti-capitalist, anti-war politics are often omitted from mainstream commemorations of his legacy, which tend to focus on his earlier civil rights work and sanitize his more radical economic and foreign policy positions.

## 9. The Assassination of Fred Hampton (December 4, 1969)

### Background

**Fact:** Fred Hampton was a 21-year-old Illinois Black Panther Party chairman.

**Fact:** FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover privately called the Black Panther Party "the greatest threat to the internal security of the country."

**Fact:** To the FBI, Hampton was another potential "messiah" rising up through the ranks of the Black Panther Party and being groomed for national leadership.

**Source:** [PBS - A Huey P. Newton Story - COINTELPRO](https://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_cointelpro.html)

### The Raid

**Fact:** In December 1969, Fred Hampton was drugged, then shot and killed in his bed during a predawn raid at his Chicago apartment by a tactical unit of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, who received aid from the Chicago Police Department and the FBI.

**Fact:** Hampton was 21 years old. Fellow Black Panther Party member Mark Clark, 22, was also killed by 14 police officers as they lay sleeping.

**Fact:** Law enforcement sprayed more than 100 gunshots throughout the apartment; the occupants fired once.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Fred Hampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton)

### FBI's Role (Declassified Documents)

**Fact:** While authorities claimed the Panthers had opened fire on the police who were there to serve a search warrant, evidence later emerged that the FBI (as part of COINTELPRO), the Cook County state's attorney's office, and the Chicago police conspired to assassinate Fred Hampton.

**Fact:** One of the most damning pieces of evidence was an FBI memo authorizing the payment of a "bonus" to an informant named William O'Neal, a security guard for the Black Panthers who supplied the FBI with the map of the apartment.

**Fact:** O'Neal was Hampton's trusted friend and bodyguard and was in charge of security the night of Hampton's murder. During the night of December 3, it is widely believed that he drugged Fred Hampton to ensure that he would not be able to defend himself.

**Source:** [HuffPost - The FBI COINTELPRO Program and the Fred Hampton Assassination](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-fbi-cointelpro-progra_b_4375527)

### January 2021 FOIA Release

**Fact:** In January 2021, more than 50 years after the police killing of Hampton, hundreds of suppressed FBI documents related to the COINTELPRO program were released through a Freedom of Information Act request.

**Fact:** Among those documents was a "bonus" letter from the desk of Hoover himself, dated six days after Hampton's murder, thanking Roy Martin Mitchell, the Chicago FBI agent who orchestrated the raid, for his "exemplary efforts."

**Source:** [Chicago Sun-Times - The killing of Fred Hampton, the FBI](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/1/24/22244731/new-fbi-records-black-panthers-police-reform-fred-hampton-mark-clark-editorial)

### The Cover-Up and Legal Aftermath

**Fact:** The physical evidence soon exposed the claims of a "shootout" as blatant lies - police fired nearly 100 shots while the Panthers fired but one.

**Fact:** In January 1970, the Cook County Coroner held an inquest, and the coroner's jury concluded that Hampton's and Clark's deaths were justifiable homicides.

**Fact:** A civil lawsuit for wrongful death was filed on behalf of the survivors and relatives. It was resolved in 1982 by a settlement of $1.85 million; the U.S. federal government, Cook County, and the City of Chicago each paid one-third to a group of nine plaintiffs.

**Fact:** The Wounded Knee Occupation began on February 27, 1973, when approximately 200 Oglala Lakota and followers of the American Indian Movement (AIM) seized and occupied the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

**Fact:** The protest followed the failure of an effort to use impeachment to remove tribal president Richard Wilson, whom activists accused of corruption and abuse of opponents. Wilson was viewed as a corrupt puppet of the BIA by some segments of the tribe.

**Fact:** Protesters also criticized the United States government's failure to fulfill treaties with Native American people and demanded the reopening of treaty negotiations.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Wounded Knee Occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Occupation)

**Fact:** U.S. government law enforcement, including FBI agents, surrounded Wounded Knee the same day with armed reinforcements.

**Fact:** By the third day, more than 300 federal agents, including the FBI, had converged on the area.

**Fact:** Oglala and AIM activists controlled the town for 71 days while the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI agents, and other law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area.

**Source:** [HISTORY - AIM occupation of Wounded Knee begins](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/february-27/aim-occupation-of-wounded-knee-begins)

### Casualties and Resolution

**Fact:** Residents complained of physical attacks and intimidation by President Richard Wilson's followers, the so-called GOONS (Guardians of the Oglala Nation).

**Fact:** More than sixty people, many of them AIM members, were murdered in factional violence between 1973 and 1976.

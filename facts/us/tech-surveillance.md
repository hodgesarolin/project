## Surveillance Capitalism

### Shoshana Zuboff's Framework

Shoshana Zuboff, Harvard Business School professor, coined the term "surveillance capitalism" in her landmark 2019 book "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism." Her framework provides the theoretical foundation for understanding how tech companies monetize human behavior.

#### Core Definition

> Surveillance capitalism is "the unilateral claiming of private human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data." These data are computed and packaged as "prediction products" sold into "behavioral markets."

**Source:** [Harvard Gazette - Harvard professor says surveillance capitalism is undermining democracy](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/)

#### The Data Extraction Cycle

1. **Users generate data** through normal platform usage
2. **Companies collect it** - including "behavioral surplus" beyond what's needed for service improvement
3. **Algorithms process it** into predictive models
4. **Prediction products are sold** to advertisers and other businesses

Google pioneered this model by discovering that "surplus behavioral data" - more than what was needed for services - could be used to predict user behavior and sold to advertisers.

**Source:** [Harvard Business School - The Age of Surveillance Capitalism](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=56791)

#### Behavioral Modification

Zuboff identifies a critical evolution: companies discovered that **better predictions require not just observing behavior, but shaping it**.

> Companies develop "economies of action," learning to tune, herd, and condition behavior with subtle cues, rewards, and punishments.

This represents a shift from monitoring to what data scientists call **"actuating"** - actively intervening in behavior to make it more predictable and profitable.

**Source:** [Project Syndicate - Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff](https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/surveillance-capitalism-exploiting-behavioral-data-by-shoshana-zuboff-2020-01)

#### "Big Other" - Distributed Power

Unlike Orwell's centralized "Big Brother," Zuboff describes **"Big Other"** as:

> A distributed architecture of power constituted by "unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification."

Key characteristics:
- **Decentralized** - operated by multiple private corporations
- **Invisible** - users often unaware of data collection scope
- **Commercial** - driven by profit, not state ideology

**Source:** [SSRN - Big Other: Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information Civilization](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754)

#### Democratic Implications

Zuboff argues surveillance capitalism threatens democracy on two levels:

1. **From within:** The "means of behavioral modification" at scale erodes capacity for the moral judgment and critical thinking necessary for democratic participation
2. **From without:** Represents an unprecedented concentration of knowledge and power in private hands

> What is abrogated is "our right to the future tense, which is the essence of free will" - the idea that individuals can project themselves into the future and make it a meaningful aspect of the present.

## Government Surveillance Programs

### The Snowden Revelations (2013)

In June 2013, Edward Snowden, a contractor working for the NSA and CIA, leaked thousands of classified documents to journalists at The Guardian and The Washington Post. These revelations fundamentally changed public understanding of government surveillance.

#### PRISM Program

PRISM collected stored internet communications based on demands made to tech companies under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008.

**Companies involved:**
- Microsoft
- Yahoo
- Google
- Facebook
- YouTube
- Skype
- Apple

**What was collected:**
- Emails
- Chat logs
- Video/voice calls
- Photos
- File transfers
- Social networking details
- Login activity

**Source:** [Wikipedia - PRISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM)

#### Upstream Collection

Beyond PRISM, the NSA also conducted "Upstream" collection - tapping directly into the internet backbone infrastructure to collect communications in transit.

**Source:** [EFF - Upstream vs. PRISM](https://www.eff.org/pages/upstream-prism)

#### Legal Foundation and Court Rulings

In 2020, a federal appeals court found the program violated constitutional rights when used to indiscriminately collect information on U.S. citizens without a warrant. However, PRISM continues to operate under Section 702 of FISA, which allows intelligence agencies to collect data on foreigners.

**Source:** [CloudWards - What Is the PRISM Program?](https://www.cloudwards.net/prism-snowden-and-government-surveillance/)

### FISA Courts and Section 702

#### History and Origins

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (1978) was enacted after revelations of systematic surveillance abuses in the 1960s and 70s, including:

- FBI's COINTELPRO targeting civil rights leaders
- Surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr.
- Monitoring of anti-war activists and members of Congress
- Abuses revealed by the Church Committee (1975)

FISA created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review and approve surveillance warrants - a secret court creating a legal process where none existed before.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act)

#### Post-9/11 Expansion

In 2001, President Bush authorized the NSA to begin warrantless wiretapping without FISA court approval. The program monitored phone calls, Internet activities, text messages, and other communications involving any party believed to be outside the U.S.

When revealed by the New York Times in December 2005, the program sparked national controversy. A federal judge ruled it unconstitutional in 2006, but the case was dismissed on standing grounds.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - NSA warrantless surveillance (2001-2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_(2001â2007))

#### Section 702 Reauthorization (2024)

In 2024, Congress renewed and expanded Section 702 with President Biden's signature. Critical details:

- The NSA uses Section 702 to place **more than 125,000 targets** under surveillance annually
- These targets need not be spies or terrorists - they can be journalists, researchers, or anyone with information on "foreign affairs"
- Shortly after reauthorization, the FBI's deputy director emailed agents urging them to "use" Section 702

**Source:** [Brennan Center - Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Resource Page](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/foreign-intelligence-surveillance-fisa-section-702-executive-order-12333)

#### Documented Abuses

The ACLU has documented numerous violations:

- FBI agents conducted **over 200,000 "backdoor searches"** for Americans' communications in one year
- FBI searched for communications of a U.S. senator, a state senator, and a state court judge
- The FISA Court described FBI violations as "persistent and widespread"

> FISC opinions describe FBI use of Section 702 to surveil a sitting state court judge who "had complained to [the] FBI about alleged civil rights violations perpetrated by a municipal chief of police."

**Source:** [ACLU - Government Releases New Court Opinions Highlighting Further Abuse](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/government-releases-new-court-opinions-highlighting-further-abuse-of-warrantless-fisa-surveillance-program)

### Fusion Centers

#### What They Are

Fusion centers are state-owned facilities that aggregate and share threat-related information between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement. As of 2018, DHS recognized **79 fusion centers** nationwide.

Personnel are drawn from:
- DHS
- FBI
- Drug Enforcement Administration
- Customs and Border Protection
- National Guard
- State police
- Local police departments
- Private sector contractors

**Source:** [DHS - Fusion Centers](https://www.dhs.gov/fusion-centers)

#### Civil Liberties Concerns

The ACLU and even DHS itself have raised concerns about:

**Mission Creep:**
- Originally focused on terrorism, fusion centers now monitor broad categories of "suspicious activity"
- A Washington State center allegedly added peace activists to a "domestic terrorists" list
- An Oregon center monitored protesters organizing against fossil fuel projects

**First Amendment Violations:**
- New Jersey created intelligence dossiers on "known troublemakers" engaged in legitimate protest
- Centers have repeatedly targeted minority communities and protest movements
- Early fusion centers singled out American Muslims for unwarranted scrutiny

**Security Vulnerabilities:**
- A 2020 breach exposed hundreds of thousands of sensitive records from the FBI, DHS, and other agencies

## Tech Companies and Authoritarianism

### Apple in China

Apple has made significant compromises to maintain access to the Chinese market:

#### iCloud Data Transfer

In 2017, Apple announced it would transfer Chinese iCloud data to servers operated by state-owned Guizhou-Cloud Big Data (GCBD). Critical changes:

- **Encryption keys moved to China:** Previously stored on U.S. servers subject to U.S. law
- **New terms of service:** "Apple and GCBD will have access to all data that you store on this service" and can share it "between each other under applicable law"
- **Streamlined government access:** Chinese authorities now request data from GCBD, not Apple
- **No notification required:** Police can access data without notifying Apple or users

**Source:** [The Hacker News - How Apple Gave Chinese Government Access to iCloud Data](https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/how-apple-gave-chinese-government.html)

#### App Censorship

Apple proactively reviews and rejects apps dealing with sensitive topics. Since 2017, Apple has:

- Deleted **thousands of apps** from the Chinese App Store
- Removed **over 600 news apps** including New York Times, Radio Free Asia, Voice of Tibet
- Blocked censorship circumvention tools like **Tor and Psiphon**
- Removed Google's search app and Google Earth
- While simultaneously hosting apps by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (on U.S. sanctions list)

**Source:** [ARTICLE 19 - Apple says it cares about digital rights. Unless you're in China.](https://www.article19.org/resources/apple-cares-about-digital-rights-unless-youre-in-china/)

### Google's Project Dragonfly

#### The Secret Project

In 2018, The Intercept revealed Google was developing "Project Dragonfly" - a censored search engine for China. The project would:

- **Blacklist websites and search terms** about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest
- **Link searches to phone numbers** for identification
- **Share data with a Chinese joint venture partner**, enabling government access

**Source:** [The Intercept via Medium - Project Dragonfly: Google's Controversial Return to China](https://ravielakshmanan.medium.com/googles-return-to-china-after-8-years-a-timeline-9778ece99fc3)

#### Employee and Public Resistance

- **Over 600 Google employees** signed a letter demanding the project end
- Human-rights activists protested at Google offices in **10 countries**
- The Stop Google Censorship campaign included Tibetan and Uighur groups

Google CEO Sundar Pichai stated there were no plans to launch "right now" but refused to rule it out entirely. The Intercept reported the project "effectively ended" but Google never confirmed this.

**Source:** [NBC News - Google's 'Project Dragonfly' censored search engine triggers protests](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-s-project-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-triggers-protests-n960121)

## Social Media's Role in Radicalization

### Facebook and the Myanmar Genocide

The case of Facebook and the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar stands as the most devastating example of social media facilitating mass atrocities.

#### What Happened

In 2017, Myanmar's military conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya Muslim minority, killing thousands and driving over 700,000 into Bangladesh. Facebook was the primary communications platform in Myanmar.

#### Amnesty International Findings (2022)

> Meta's dangerous algorithms and reckless pursuit of profit substantially contributed to the atrocities perpetrated by the Myanmar military against the Rohingya people in 2017.

Key findings:
- Meta's algorithms **"proactively amplified and promoted content"** inciting violent hatred against the Rohingya beginning as early as 2012
- Internal studies from 2016 acknowledged that **"our recommendation systems grow the problem"** of extremism
- Meta knew its algorithms could result in serious real-world harms

**Source:** [Amnesty International - Myanmar: Facebook's systems promoted violence against Rohingya](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/)

#### The Business Model Problem

> Meta profits when Facebook users stay on the platform as long as possible, by selling more targeted advertising. The display of inflammatory content is an effective way of keeping people on the platform longer.

The promotion and amplification of inflammatory content is **built into the surveillance capitalism business model**.

**Source:** [Global Witness - Facebook's algorithm amplified pro-military content](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/myanmars-military-massacred-civilians-facebooks-algorithm-amplified-pro-military-misleading-and-violent-content/)

#### Post-Coup Continuation (2021)

After Myanmar's military seized power on February 1, 2021, Facebook banned the armed forces. But within a month, as soldiers massacred hundreds of unarmed civilians, Facebook's own recommendation algorithm was **amplifying content that violated its own policies** on violence and misinformation.

#### Legal Actions

Advocates in the US, UK, and Ireland have filed three cases against Meta seeking **more than $150 billion** in damages for contributing to genocide.

**Source:** [Journal of Genocide Research - Beyond Hate Speech and Misinformation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14623528.2024.2375122)

### Algorithmic Radicalization Research

#### TikTok Studies (2024)

A 2024 study in *Social Science Computer Review* examined TikTok's role in fostering radicalized ideology through algorithm audits:

> The results revealed that the pathways through which users access far-right content are manifold and that a large portion of the content can be ascribed to platform recommendations through radicalization pipelines.

A UCL-led study found that after five days, TikTok's algorithm presented **four times as many videos with misogynistic content** - increasing from 13% to 56% of recommended videos.

**Source:** [SAGE Journals - How Algorithms Promote Self-Radicalization: Audit of TikTok's Algorithm](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08944393231225547)

#### YouTube Findings

Research shows mixed results for YouTube:
- Studies suggest YouTube's recommendation system may actually **pull users away from political extremes**
- However, this pull is asymmetric - users are pulled away from Far Right content more strongly than Far Left

**Source:** [PNAS Nexus - YouTube's recommendation algorithm is left-leaning in the United States](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/8/pgad264/7242446)

#### Real-World Consequences

- **Vienna 2024:** Teenagers arrested for planning a terrorist attack at a Taylor Swift concert had been radicalized partly through TikTok content
- **Bangladesh 2024:** Research examined how Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram catalyzed public unrest, propagated disinformation, and amplified ideological polarization leading to real-world violence

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Algorithmic radicalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_radicalization)

### Twitter/X Under Musk

#### Political Transformation

Following Elon Musk's October 2022 acquisition of Twitter:

> The New York Times described Musk as "the richest man in the world [who] has involved himself in the U.S. election in a manner unparalleled in modern history."

Key developments:
- By July 2024, Musk fully endorsed Trump and committed tens of millions to a pro-Trump super PAC
- Musk turned his personal feed into a "non-stop pro-Trump megaphone" with 20+ political posts per day
- Because Musk owns the platform, his political commentary became a "built-in feature of the service"
- Musk became head of DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) in the Trump administration

**Source:** [The Boar - A big X over its future](https://theboar.org/2025/06/a-big-x-over-its-future-how-one-man-is-changing-the-social-media-universe/)

#### Content Moderation Gutting

Musk's changes to content policy:

**Policies removed:**
- Crisis misinformation
- COVID-19 misleading information
- Misinformation about election outcomes
- The concept of "informational harm"

**Structural changes:**
- Fired more than half of Twitter employees
- Disbanded trust and safety teams
- Shifted to "softer sanctions" across policy areas

> Musk told journalist Don Lemon that content moderation is "a propaganda word for censorship."

**Source:** [HIIG - Two years after the takeover: Four key policy changes of X under Musk](https://www.hiig.de/en/policy-changes-of-x-under-musk/)

#### Community Notes Interference

In February 2025, Musk argued that Community Notes was "increasingly being gamed by governments & legacy media" after the feature contradicted his claims about astronauts and statements about Ukrainian President Zelenskyy.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Twitter under Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_under_Elon_Musk)

#### Platform Decline

- Analysts project X will lose **7 million US monthly active users** between 2022 and 2025
- Internal data showed **40% year-over-year decline in US ad revenue** by mid-2024
- Users migrating to Bluesky and Threads

**Source:** [Website Planet - The X-odus: How User Departures Are Reshaping Social Media](https://www.websiteplanet.com/blog/people-and-companies-leaving-x/)

### Foreign Influence Operations (2024 Election)

Russia, China, and Iran all actively sought to influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

#### Russian Operations

- RT (Russian state media) allegedly funneled **nearly $10 million** to conservative U.S. influencers
- Created fake sites designed to look like U.S. news organizations
- Microsoft observed Russia pivoting to target the Harris-Walz campaign with fabricated videos
- On Election Day, hoax bomb threats to polling locations originated from Russian email domains

**Source:** [NPR - Foreign influence efforts reached a fever pitch during the 2024 elections](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/09/nx-s1-5181965/2024-election-foreign-influence-russia-china-iran)

#### Chinese Operations

- "Spamouflage" operation: Chinese-controlled accounts masqueraded as U.S. users
- Focus on downballot races rather than presidential election
- Amplified discord around topics like pro-Palestine protests on college campuses

**Source:** [Brookings - Foreign influence operations in the 2024 elections](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/foreign-influence-operations-in-the-2024-elections/)

#### Iranian Operations

- Hackers obtained documents from the Trump campaign and attempted to leak them
- The DOJ alleged Iran attempted to assassinate Trump
- Conducted hack-and-leak operations targeting the Republican campaign

## AI and Authoritarian Surveillance

### China's Surveillance State

#### Scale and Technology

China has deployed the world's most comprehensive AI-powered surveillance system:

- Estimated **200-400 million CCTV cameras** (approximately 1 camera per 7 citizens)
- Technologies include: facial recognition, gait analysis, and machine learning
- Government AI tools are used to "automate censorship, enhance surveillance and pre-emptively suppress dissent"
- Systems can predict public demonstrations and monitor the moods of prison inmates

**Source:** [CNN - China's censorship and surveillance were already intense. AI is turbocharging those systems](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/china/china-ai-censorship-surveillance-report-intl-hnk)

#### Targeting of Uyghurs

There is strong evidence that facial recognition systems are being used specifically to target citizens of Uyghur background in Xinjiang province.

**Source:** [SCMP - Drones, facial recognition and a social credit system: 10 ways China watches its citizens](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2157883/drones-facial-recognition-and-social-credit-system-10-ways-china)

#### New Facial Recognition Regulations (2025)

On June 1, 2025, China's first dedicated facial recognition regulations took effect. They came after public backlash over incidents like Shanghai hotels mandating facial scans. Individuals must not be forced to verify identity through facial recognition.

**Source:** [China Development Brief - Security Management Measures Concerning the Application of Facial Recognition Technology](https://chinadevelopmentbrief.org/reports/security-management-measures-concerning-the-application-of-facial-recognition-technology/)

### Social Credit System: Reality vs. Myth

#### Current Status (2024)

Despite Western media portrayals:

> As of 2024, there still seems to be little progress on rolling out a nationwide social credit score. All private social credit ratings have been shut down, and most local government pilots have ended.

Reality:
- No unified national credit score exists
- The system primarily targets **businesses**, not individuals
- Most penalties apply to repeat offenders or those who have broken the law
- Government appears to be slowing down on individual score implementation

**Source:** [Remote People - China Social Credit System in 2024](https://remotepeople.com/countries/china/social-credit-system/)

#### Global Export

The growing ecosystem of Chinese AI surveillance tools has global implications, with other authoritarian countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia also using AI to surveil their populations.

**Source:** [Vaia - AI Surveillance in China: Privacy & Control](https://www.vaia.com/en-us/explanations/chinese/chinese-social-issues/ai-surveillance-in-china/)

### Facial Recognition in the United States

#### Clearview AI

Clearview AI has scraped and cataloged **over 50 billion facial images** from the public internet including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Venmo. The company provides facial recognition software primarily to law enforcement.

**Legal battles:**
- ACLU lawsuit filed citing Illinois biometric privacy law
- June 2024 settlement: Clearview offered 23% of company (valued at $52 million) in lieu of cash payment
- September 2024: Fined â¬30.5 million by Dutch Data Protection Authority

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Clearview AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearview_AI)

#### Jurisdictional Bans

Over 20 jurisdictions have restricted law enforcement use of facial recognition:
- San Francisco
- Boston
- Minneapolis
- Portland
- The State of Vermont
- Los Angeles (Clearview AI specifically banned)

**Source:** [ACLU - Facial Recognition Technology Comments](https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ACLU-Comment-to-USCCR-re-FRT-4.8.2024.pdf)

#### Federal Agency Issues

A GAO review found that 7 agencies used facial recognition without requiring staff training. DHS and DOJ have since developed policies addressing:
- Limiting use of the technology
- Protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties
- Testing and evaluation requirements

**Source:** [GAO - Facial Recognition Technology: Federal Law Enforcement Agency Efforts](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-107372)

### Predictive Policing

#### How It Works

Predictive policing uses computer systems to analyze historical crime data and other information to decide where to deploy police or identify individuals "more likely" to commit crimes.

#### Racial Bias Problems

The NAACP has documented fundamental problems:

> Relying on historical criminal data to make policing decisions is inherently biased, as data shows that the Black community is disproportionately negatively impacted in the criminal justice system due to targeted over-policing.

**Feedback loops:** If most data comes from heavily policed areas, AI commits more resources to those places, further entrenching biased practices.

**Proxy variables:** Though algorithms don't explicitly use race, variables like socioeconomic background, education, and zip code act as racial proxies.

**Source:** [NAACP - Artificial Intelligence in Predictive Policing Issue Brief](https://naacp.org/resources/artificial-intelligence-predictive-policing-issue-brief)

#### COMPAS Risk Assessment

COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is used to predict likelihood of reoffending for bail, sentencing, and parole decisions. Studies indicate it **disproportionately labels Black defendants as high-risk** compared to white defendants.

**Source:** [OxJournal - Predictive Policing or Predictive Prejudice?](https://www.oxjournal.org/predictive-policing-or-predictive-prejudice/)

#### Department Pullbacks

Leading police departments including Los Angeles and Chicago have **phased out or significantly reduced** predictive policing programs following independent audits and civil rights concerns.

## Tech Billionaires and Political Power

### Peter Thiel and Palantir

#### Background

Palantir was founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel, with original funding from the CIA. The New York Times described Thiel as "the most influential right-wing intellectual of the last 20 years."

**Source:** [NPR - How Palantir, the secretive tech company, is rising in the Trump era](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/01/nx-s1-5372776/palantir-tech-contracts-trump)

#### Government Contract Explosion

Federal contracts have grown dramatically:
- 2009: $4.4 million
- 2024: $541.2 million
- 2025: $970.5 million (nearly doubled from 2024)

Palantir secured a nearly **$1 billion Navy software contract** in November. Since Trump took office, the company's stock has surged more than 200%.

**Source:** [The Hill - Palantir courts major federal contractsâand controversyâin Trump era](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5667232-palantir-trump-administration-surveillance/)

#### Immigration Enforcement

Palantir has been tapped to compile a "master database" for the Trump administration, cross-referencing:
- Tax records
- Immigration records
- Other sensitive data

Palantir also has a **$30 million contract with ICE** for "ImmigrationOS" - providing near real-time visibility into immigrants' movements as ICE seeks to arrest 3,000 people daily.

**Source:** [Democracy Now! - Palantir: Peter Thiel's Data-Mining Firm Helps DOGE Build Master Database](https://www.democracynow.org/2025/6/3/makena_kelly)

#### DOGE Integration

Palantir has become deeply integrated with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), building a "mega API" for the IRS to create unified access to all databases - potentially enabling comprehensive taxpayer surveillance.

#### Political Connections

> "Having political connections and inroads with Peter Thiel and Elon Musk certainly helps them. It makes deals come faster without a lot of negotiation and pressure." - Michael McGrath, former CEO of i2

Thiel has direct access to the president, vice president, and virtually every tech figure in Trump's inner circle. He hosted an inauguration party at his Washington mansion.

**Source:** [PassBlue - Palantir, Seemingly Everywhere All at Once](https://passblue.com/2025/10/12/palantir-seemingly-everywhere-all-at-once/)

#### Internal Dissent

Following news of immigration enforcement assistance:
- Silicon Valley investor Paul Graham accused Palantir of "building the infrastructure of the police state"
- 13 former employees signed a public letter urging the company to reconsider its role
- At least one strategist resigned over expanded ICE contracts

**Source:** [Davis Vanguard - Bay Area Residents Protest Palantir and Peter Thiel's Influence](https://davisvanguard.org/2025/08/bay-area-protests-palantir-thiel/)

### Elon Musk's Political Role

As documented in the Twitter/X section, Musk has:
- Endorsed Trump and contributed tens of millions to his campaign
- Become head of DOGE in the Trump administration
- Transformed X into a pro-Trump platform
- Accumulated unprecedented political influence through platform ownership

## Data as Power

### The Data Broker Industry

#### Scale of Personal Data Collection

Cambridge Analytica claimed to have **approximately 5,000 different data points** on American voters. Alexander Nix stated in 2016:

> "Today in the United States we have somewhere close to four or five thousand data points on every individual... So we model the personality of every adult across the United States, some 230 million people."

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica)

#### How Data Is Aggregated

Cambridge Analytica combined multiple sources:
- Demographics
- Consumer behavior
- Internet activity
- Public records
- Commercial data brokers (Acxiom, Experian, Infogroup)
- Psychographic profiles derived from Facebook data (often without user permission)

**Source:** [ProPublica - How Gun Lobby, Cambridge Analytica Used Customer Data](https://www.propublica.org/article/guns-lobbying-cambridge-analytica-nssf-privacy-elections)

#### Government as Data Customer

According to a 2024 Brennan Center analysis:

> Agencies like the Department of Defense and local law enforcement have routinely purchased location and behavioral data from brokers to sidestep constitutional limits on surveillance. Because the data is technically available on the open market, the government argues it doesn't need a warrant.

**Source:** [Proton - How data brokers threaten privacy and undermine democracy](https://proton.me/blog/data-brokers-democracy)

### Surveillance of Activists and Journalists

#### Pegasus Spyware

NSO Group's Pegasus spyware has been used to target human rights activists and journalists worldwide. Recent developments:

**May 2025 Legal Victory:**
Meta won a lawsuit against NSO Group: **$167.3 million in punitive damages** and $444,719 in compensatory damages - the first time NSO has been held financially accountable.

**Source:** [Amnesty International - Ruling against NSO Group in WhatsApp case](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/05/ruling-against-nso-group-in-whatsapp-case-a-momentous-win/)

**Recent Targeting:**
- **Serbia 2025:** Two BIRN journalists targeted with Pegasus (third incident in two years in Serbia)
- **Jordan 2024:** Over 30 journalists, lawyers, and activists infected between 2020-2023
- **Thailand:** Activist Jatupat Boonpattararaksa's phone infected three times in 2021

Investigations identified at least **180 journalists from 20 countries** selected for targeting between 2016 and June 2021.

**U.S. Ownership:**
In 2025, American investors acquired NSO for tens of millions of dollars, despite Pegasus being listed by the Commerce Department as a national security threat.

### Political Targeting and Voter Surveillance

#### The Cambridge Analytica Model

The Cambridge Analytica scandal was not an aberration:

> It was an inevitable consequence of a system founded on harvesting and monetizing information â the business model called "surveillance capitalism." Cambridge Analytica simply deployed the same basic model to target voters rather than consumers.

#### Ongoing Vulnerabilities

In 2024, Cards Against Humanity released an experiment demonstrating how much information PACs and Super PACs can legally purchase about voters. The Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act would prohibit law enforcement from purchasing data they'd otherwise need a warrant to obtain - but it remains stalled in Congress.

## Resistance and Privacy Tools

### Essential Privacy Tools

#### Encrypted Messaging

**Signal** is widely regarded as the gold standard for private messaging:
- End-to-end encryption
- No metadata collection
- Open source protocol

**Real-world use:** During Nigeria's #EndSARS protests, journalists and activists relied on Signal and VPNs to coordinate safely when government surveillance was escalating.

#### Anonymous Browsing

**Tor Browser:**
- Routes traffic through multiple encrypted nodes
- Makes it extremely difficult to trace online activity or physical location
- Essential for activists and journalists in repressive environments

**Tails OS:**
- Operating system that runs from USB drive
- Leaves no digital footprint on host machine
- Designed for maximum security

#### Secure File Sharing

**OnionShare:**
- Uses Tor Onion Services
- Tunnels data directly from sender to recipient
- No third-party servers

### Current Threats to Encryption

#### EU "Chat Control" Proposal

Tech experts warn that pending European regulation known as "Chat Control" would:
- Grant governments authority to scan messages on personal devices
- Undermine encrypted communications
- Threaten journalists, activists, domestic abuse survivors, and political dissidents

#### Global Internet Restrictions

**4.8 billion people** were affected by internet censorship in 2024. The first six months of 2025 saw 24 cases of internet restrictions globally.

### Organizations Providing Digital Security Training

- **Human Rights Journalists Network Nigeria**
- **Paradigm Initiative**
- **Access Now**
- **The Tor Project**
- **Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)**
- **Freedom of the Press Foundation**

### What Works

#### For Individuals

1. **Use end-to-end encrypted messaging** (Signal over SMS/standard messaging)
2. **Use Tor Browser** for sensitive research
3. **Consider Tails OS** for high-risk situations
4. **Use VPNs** (though they shift trust rather than eliminating it)
5. **Enable two-factor authentication** on all accounts
6. **Be aware of metadata** - who you communicate with can reveal as much as content

#### For Organizations

1. **Implement organizational security policies**
2. **Provide regular digital security training**
3. **Use secure cloud storage** for sensitive documents
4. **Assume compromise** - design systems accordingly
5. **Support encryption advocacy** - individual security depends on widespread adoption

## Key Takeaways

### The Surveillance-Profit Connection

The surveillance capitalism business model creates structural incentives that:
- Prioritize data extraction over user privacy
- Reward engagement at any cost (including amplifying harmful content)
- Concentrate unprecedented power in corporate hands
- Create infrastructure easily repurposed for authoritarian control

### Government-Corporate Collaboration

The line between corporate and government surveillance has blurred:
- Tech companies provide data to governments (voluntarily or by compulsion)
- Governments purchase data from commercial brokers to evade warrant requirements
- Public-private surveillance partnerships operate with minimal oversight

### Authoritarian Technology Export

Surveillance technologies developed in both democratic and authoritarian contexts spread globally:
- Chinese AI surveillance tools used by Iran, Saudi Arabia, and others
- Pegasus spyware sold to dozens of governments for use against journalists and activists
- Predictive policing algorithms exported despite documented racial bias

### Democratic Vulnerabilities

Democratic institutions are poorly equipped to address these challenges:
- FISA courts operate in secret with minimal adversarial process
- Fusion centers lack adequate oversight
- Data protection legislation remains stalled
- Platform regulation struggles to keep pace with technological change

### The Importance of Encryption

Strong encryption remains the most effective tool for protecting privacy:
- Governments worldwide are attempting to weaken it
- Advocacy organizations are defending encryption rights
- Individual adoption of encrypted tools is a form of collective action

## Voter Suppression History

**Timeline: 1870 to Present**

### The Pattern

Voter suppression in America follows a consistent pattern: legal barriers are created, struck down, and then reconstituted in new forms. The targets remain largely the sameâBlack Americans, poor whites, and other marginalized communities.

### Reconstruction Era (1865-1877)

**FACT:** The 15th Amendment (1870) guaranteed the right to vote regardless of "race, color, or previous condition of servitude."

**FACT:** African American voter turnout was initially high after the amendment's passage, with Black communities electing hundreds of state representatives and 16 Black U.S. representatives and senators by 1870.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Voter Suppression in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States)

### Post-Reconstruction Suppression (1877-1965)

**FACT:** After federal troops withdrew from the South in 1877 (ending Reconstruction), white Democrats regained power using paramilitary groups like the White League and Red Shirts to intimidate Black voters.

**FACT:** From 1890 to 1908, Southern states passed new constitutions and laws creating:
- **Poll taxes** (cumulative in Alabama, requiring payment of all taxes from age 21)
- **Literacy tests** (administered discriminatorilyâin Macon County, Alabama, in the 1950s, uneducated whites passed while college-educated Blacks failed)
- **Grandfather clauses**
- **White primaries**

**Source:** [ABC News - Timeline: Voter Suppression in the US](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-voter-suppression-us-civil-war-today/story?id=72248473)

**FACT:** Twenty states still had literacy tests after World War II, not just Southern states.

**Source:** [Britannica - Voter Suppression](https://www.britannica.com/topic/voter-suppression)

### Civil Rights Era Reforms (1960s-1970s)

**FACT:** The 24th Amendment (1964) prohibited poll taxes in federal elections.

**FACT:** The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA):
- Banned discriminatory application of literacy tests
- Required federal pre-clearance for voting law changes in states with histories of discrimination (Section 5)
- By 1980, Black voter registration in the South had surpassed the rest of the country

**FACT:** A 1970 amendment to the VRA prohibited all literacy tests nationwide.

**Source:** [CNN - Black Voting Rights and Voter Suppression Timeline](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2021/05/politics/black-voting-rights-suppression-timeline/)

### Modern Era (2013-Present)

**FACT:** *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013) struck down the VRA's coverage formula (Section 4b), effectively gutting federal pre-clearance requirements.

**FACT:** Within 24 hours of the *Shelby County* ruling:
- Texas announced implementation of the nation's most restrictive voter ID law (previously blocked by pre-clearance)
- Alabama implemented a previously blocked voter ID law and subsequently closed DMV offices in 8 of 10 counties with the highest Black populations

**Source:** [Brennan Center - Effects of Shelby County v. Holder](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/effects-shelby-county-v-holder-voting-rights-act)

**FACT:** As of March 2021, more than 361 bills restricting voting access had been introduced in 47 states since the *Shelby County* ruling.

**FACT:** The racial turnout gap has grown since 2012, particularly in formerly covered states. A 2024 Brennan Center study found that if this gap had not existed in 2020, 9 million more ballots would have been cast.

**Source:** [NAACP LDF - Impact of Shelby County v. Holder](https://www.naacpldf.org/shelby-county-v-holder-impact/)

### Gerrymandering as Voter Suppression

**FACT:** In North Carolina (2013), courts found Republican legislators "assigned race [as] a priority over all other districting factors," packing Black voters into districts to dilute their statewide power. The Supreme Court ordered new maps.

**FACT:** In Wisconsin, despite Democrats winning a majority of statewide votes, Republicans won 60 of 99 Assembly seats due to gerrymandering. In December 2023, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the maps unconstitutional.

**Source:** [ProPublica - Partisan Gerrymandering Is Still About Race](https://www.propublica.org/article/partisan-gerrymandering-is-still-about-race)

> **ANALYSIS:** The methods change but the goal remains constant: limiting the political power of Black Americans and other marginalized groups. Poll taxes became voter ID laws. Literacy tests became "exact match" signature requirements. Grandfather clauses became felon disenfranchisement. Each generation creates new barriers after the old ones are struck down.

## Immigration Policy

**Theme: Who Was Wanted When and Why**

### The Pattern

US immigration policy has consistently reflected economic needs and racial hierarchies. Workers are imported when needed, excluded or deported when not, and the rules change based on which ethnic groups are deemed "desirable."

### Early Exclusionary Era (1875-1924)

**FACT:** The Page Act (1875) was the first restrictive immigration law, targeting Asian immigrants by prohibiting "coolies" and suspected prostitutes.

**FACT:** The Chinese Exclusion Act (1882):
- First law to restrict immigration based on nationality
- Prohibited all Chinese laborers for 10 years
- Denied Chinese residents the ability to become citizens
- Extended by the Geary Act (1892), which also required Chinese to carry identification
- Made indefinite in 1904

**Source:** [National Archives - Chinese Exclusion Act](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/chinese-exclusion-act)

**FACT:** Chinese workers had built the transcontinental railroad and worked California gold minesâthey were targeted after their labor was no longer essential.

**Source:** [State Department - Chinese Immigration and the Chinese Exclusion Acts](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1866-1898/chinese-immigration)

### The Quota System (1917-1965)

**FACT:** The Immigration Act of 1917 implemented literacy tests for all immigrants over 16.

**FACT:** The Emergency Quota Act (1921) set the first numerical caps on immigration.

**FACT:** The Immigration Act of 1924 (Johnson-Reed Act):
- Set national origins quotas at 2% of each nationality's 1890 census population (deliberately chosen to favor Northern/Western Europeans over Southern/Eastern Europeans)
- Completely excluded immigrants from Asia
- Created the concept of "illegal immigration" for the first time

**Source:** [State Department - The Immigration Act of 1924](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/immigration-act)

### The Bracero Program (1942-1964)

**FACT:** During WWII labor shortages, the US imported over 4.5 million Mexican workers through the Bracero Program.

**FACT:** Despite promised protections (minimum 30 cents/hour, decent housing, no discrimination), workers experienced:
- Wage theft (mandatory 10% deductions for "savings" that many never received)
- Exposure to deadly chemicals
- Segregation and discrimination
- Lynchings along the Texas border (Mexico banned the program in Texas for several years)

**Source:** [Library of Congress - Bracero Program](https://guides.loc.gov/latinx-civil-rights/bracero-program)

**FACT:** Bribery was common to obtain contracts, and the system's exploitation led many to cross illegally, beginning the modern pattern of undocumented labor.

**Source:** [Britannica - Bracero Program](https://www.britannica.com/event/Bracero-Program)

### Repeal of Asian Exclusion

**FACT:** The Magnuson Act (1943) repealed Chinese exclusionâbut only because China was a WWII ally. Annual quota: 105 Chinese immigrants.

**FACT:** Asian exclusion fully ended with the Immigration Act of 1952, though it maintained racial quotas for Asian immigrants.

**Source:** [State Department - Repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/chinese-exclusion-act-repeal)

### The Hart-Celler Act (1965)

**FACT:** The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965:
- Abolished the national origins quota system
- Established preference system based on family reunification (75%), employment (20%), and refugee status (5%)
- Each country received equal annual cap of 20,000

**FACT:** Senator Ted Kennedy promised the law "will not upset the ethnic mix of our society." Within decades:
- Hispanic population: 4% (1965) â 18% (2015)
- Asian population: 1% (1965) â 6% (2015)
- Foreign-born population: 5% (1965) â 14% (2015)

**FACT:** Asian immigration in the 1970s was ten times the 1950s level.

**Source:** [Migration Policy Institute - 1965 Immigration Act](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/fifty-years-1965-immigration-and-nationality-act-continues-reshape-united-states)

**FACT:** The end of the Bracero Program combined with new Western Hemisphere caps inadvertently created the foundation for modern unauthorized immigrationâthe same workers kept coming, but now illegally.

**Source:** [History.com - How the Immigration Act of 1965 Changed America](https://www.history.com/articles/immigration-act-1965-changes)

> **ANALYSIS:** Immigration policy reveals the instrumentalization of human beings: welcomed when their labor is needed, expelled when it isn't, and always subject to racial hierarchies that determine who is "desirable." The pattern repeatsâfrom Chinese railroad workers to Mexican braceros to modern H-1B visa holders.

## US Support for Dictators

**Full List with Receipts**

### The Pattern

Throughout the Cold War and beyond, the US consistently supported authoritarian regimes that served American economic and strategic interests, regardless of human rights abuses. The justification shifted from "anti-communism" to "stability" to "strategic partnership."

### Operation Condor (1975-1983)

**FACT:** A coordinated campaign of political repression by South American dictatorships (Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Brazil, later Peru and Ecuador).

**FACT:** Created at a CIA-connected meeting in Santiago, Chile (November 1975).

**FACT:** Declassified documents reveal US agencies had "intimate knowledge" through inside sources.

**FACT:** Researcher Patrice McSherry (2019): "Washington acted as a secret partner and sponsor of Condor, particularly during the Nixon and Ford administrations."

**FACT:** Patricia Derian (Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, 1977-81) on Kissinger's role: "It sickened me that with an imperial wave of his hand, an American could sentence people to death."

**FACT:** The resulting 40-year civil war killed approximately 245,000 people.

**Source:** [National Security Archive - CIA and Guatemala](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB4/)

> **ANALYSIS:** The US supported dictators when they served American interestsâaccess to resources, military bases, anti-communist alignmentâand tolerated mass murder, torture, and corruption as acceptable costs. The "freedom and democracy" rhetoric was always selectively applied.

## Labor Rights

**Won Through Blood, Now Eroded**

### The Pattern

Every major labor right in Americaâthe 8-hour day, the weekend, the end of child labor, workplace safetyâwas won through struggle, often violent. The pattern: workers organize, employers respond with violence (often state-backed), workers persist, reforms pass, then decades of erosion follow.

### Key Massacres and Confrontations

#### The Haymarket Affair (1886)

**FACT:** On May 4, 1886, a peaceful rally for the 8-hour day in Chicago turned violent when someone threw a bomb at police. Police fired randomly into the crowd.

**FACT:** Seven police officers killed, 60 wounded. Civilian casualties: 4-8 dead, 30-40 injured.

**FACT:** Eight anarchists were convicted in a trial widely considered biased, with no evidence linking them to the bombing. Four were executed; one committed suicide.

**FACT:** This event is the origin of International Workers' Day (May 1), celebrated globallyâexcept in the United States.

**Source:** [Britannica - Haymarket Affair](https://www.britannica.com/event/Haymarket-Affair)

#### The Ludlow Massacre (1914)

**FACT:** Declared by historian Thomas G. Andrews "the deadliest strike in the history of the United States."

**FACT:** 10,000 miners struck against John D. Rockefeller's Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. Evicted from company towns, they built tent colonies.

**FACT:** On April 20, 1914, National Guard and company guards attacked the Ludlow tent colony.

**FACT:** Death toll: 19-26 people, including 11 children and 2 women who suffocated and burned in a pit beneath a tent.

**FACT:** Labor organizer Louis Tikas was captured and executed.

**FACT:** In retaliation, miners attacked mines and took control of a 50-mile area. Total dead in the aftermath: approximately 50.

**FACT:** Congressional investigation led to reforms including child labor laws and the 8-hour workday.

**Source:** [Britannica - Ludlow Massacre](https://www.britannica.com/event/Ludlow-Massacre)

#### The Battle of Blair Mountain (1921)

**FACT:** The largest labor uprising in US history and the largest armed uprising since the Civil War.

**FACT:** 10,000 armed coal miners (many WWI veterans) marched against 3,000 sheriff's deputies and mine guards.

**FACT:** Miners organized like an army division with medical units, supply chains, and passwords.

**FACT:** Sheriff Don Chafin's salary was paid by coal operators. His "Logan Defenders" had machine guns.

**FACT:** Airplanes dropped gas bombs and improvised explosives (gunpowder, nuts, and bolts) on the miners.

**FACT:** President Harding sent 2,500 federal troops and bomber aircraft. Miners refused to shoot at federal troops (many were veterans themselves).

**FACT:** Approximately one million rounds fired. 925 miners charged with murder, treason, and conspiracy.

**FACT:** UMWA membership collapsed from 50,000 (1920) to 600 (1929).

**Source:** [National Park Service - Battle of Blair Mountain](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-battle-of-blair-mountain.htm)

#### The Memorial Day Massacre (1937)

**FACT:** On May 30, 1937, striking steelworkers and families (1,500-2,500 people, including Black, white, and Latino workers) gathered for a peaceful march to Republic Steel in Chicago.

**FACT:** 300 Chicago police blocked their path and opened fire.

**FACT:** 10 killed (4 immediately, 6 later), 40 shot, 90+ wounded. Nine permanently disabled; 28 had serious head injuries from police clubs.

**FACT:** Newsreel footage was suppressed "for fear of creating mass hysteria."

**FACT:** Newspapers (including the Chicago Tribune and New York Times) initially portrayed protesters as violent attackers and police as acting in self-defense.

**FACT:** Paramount News eventually released footage for a Congressional investigation, revealing the truth.

**Source:** [Chicago History Museum - Memorial Day Massacre](https://www.chicagohistory.org/memorial-day-massacre-of-1937/)

### The Destruction of PATCO (1981)

**FACT:** On August 3, 1981, 13,000 air traffic controllers (PATCO) went on strike demanding wage increases, modern equipment, and a reduced workweek.

**FACT:** Ironically, PATCO had endorsed Reagan's 1980 campaign. Reagan had sent a letter pledging support for their demands.

**FACT:** On August 5, Reagan fired 11,345 striking controllers and banned them from federal service for life.

**FACT:** PATCO was decertifiedâthe first federal union ever decertified.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - 1981 PATCO Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Professional_Air_Traffic_Controllers_Organization_strike)

**FACT:** Effects on the labor movement:
- Before PATCO: hiring replacement workers during strikes was socially unacceptable
- After PATCO: Phelps Dodge (1983), Hormel (1985-86), International Paper (1987) all hired replacements
- Major strikes per year: 382 (late 1970s) â 150 (mid-1980s) â 17 (1999) â 11 (2010)
- Unionization rate: 20.9% (1981) â 10% (2024)

**Source:** [NPR - 1981 Strike Leaves Legacy for American Workers](https://www.npr.org/2006/08/03/5604656/1981-strike-leaves-legacy-for-american-workers)

### The Role of Violence

**FACT:** Standard employer tactics throughout labor history included:
- Hiring private security forces (Pinkertons, Baldwin-Felts)
- Using state militias and National Guard against workers
- Firing and blacklisting union members
- Exploiting ethnic tensions to divide workers
- "Yellow dog" contracts requiring workers to forswear unions

**Source:** [Jacobin - Legacy of the Crushed 1981 PATCO Strike](https://jacobin.com/2021/08/reagan-patco-1981-strike-legacy-air-traffic-controllers-union-public-sector-strikebreaking)

> **ANALYSIS:** Labor rights were not grantedâthey were extracted through sacrifice. The 8-hour day, child labor laws, workplace safety regulations all required workers to face bullets, bombs, and state violence. The erosion of these rights since 1981 demonstrates that without constant pressure, gains can be reversed within a generation.

## Environmental Racism

**Cancer Alley, Flint, Standing Rock**

### The Pattern

The placement of polluting industries, hazardous waste, and environmental hazards follows racial lines. This is not coincidence but policyâa direct legacy of housing discrimination, redlining, and the devaluation of Black and Indigenous lives.

### Definition and Origins

**FACT:** The term "environmental racism" was coined by Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. in 1982, when a Black community in Warren County, North Carolina was designated as a PCB waste dump site.

**FACT:** Environmental justice as a movement began with that 1982 protest.

**FACT:** Modern patterns derive from centuries of denying enslaved and marginalized people access to safe land.

**Source:** [Augusta University - Environmental Racism](https://www.augusta.edu/online/blog/environmental-racism)

### The Redlining Connection

**FACT:** Federal Housing Administration (FHA) policies from 1934 onward:
- Created color-coded maps marking Black neighborhoods as "hazardous" (red)
- Refused to insure mortgages in or near Black neighborhoods
- Required that FHA-backed suburban developments exclude Black buyers
- The FHA Underwriting Manual stated "incompatible racial groups should not be permitted to live in the same communities"

**FACT:** The FHA destroyed its grading maps in 1969.

**Source:** [NPR - A Forgotten History of How the US Government Segregated America](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america)

**FACT:** Result: African American wealth is about 5% of white wealth, though incomes are 60% of white incomes. The difference is almost entirely attributable to federal housing policy.

**FACT:** Redlined areas today still have:
- Higher hospital closure rates
- Less access to healthcare
- More environmental hazards
- Lower property values

**Source:** [UC Berkeley Public Health - Redlining Still Drives Health Inequities](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/articles/spotlight/research/50-years-after-being-outlawed-redlining-still-drives-neighborhood-health-inequities)

### Cancer Alley, Louisiana

**FACT:** The 85-mile stretch between Baton Rouge and New Orleans contains 25% of US petrochemical production.

**FACT:** Overall population is 40% Black, but many communities in the corridor are over 90% Black.

**FACT:** The region's demographics trace directly to post-slavery Reconstructionâthese are the descendants of enslaved people who worked the same land.

**FACT:** In 2022, the UN identified Cancer Alley as one of the most polluted places on the planet.

**FACT:** UN statement: "The African American descendants of the enslaved people who once worked the land are today the primary victims of deadly environmental pollution."

**Source:** [UN News - Environmental Racism in Louisiana's Cancer Alley](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1086172)

### Flint, Michigan Water Crisis

**FACT:** In 2014, Flint switched its water source to the Flint River without proper corrosion control, leaching lead from old pipes.

**FACT:** Over 100,000 people (majority Black, majority poor) lost access to safe drinking water.

**FACT:** Studies showed substantial percentages of children with elevated blood lead levelsâa permanent, irreversible harm.

**FACT:** State officials initially dismissed complaints and falsified test results.

**Source:** [Morningside Center - Flint Water Crisis: Environmental Racism](https://www.morningsidecenter.org/teachable-moment/lessons/flint-water-crisis-environmental-racism-work)

### Standing Rock and the Dakota Access Pipeline

**FACT:** The Dakota Access Pipeline was originally routed near Bismarck (majority white) but was rerouted after concerns about water contamination.

**FACT:** The new route crossed under Lake Oahe on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.

**FACT:** This raised concerns about:
- Water supply contamination for the reservation
- Destruction of sacred sites
- Violation of treaty rights

**FACT:** The 2016-2017 protests drew international attention and violent police response including water cannons used in freezing temperatures.

**Source:** [Singleton Schreiber - Environmental Racism and Policy Failure](https://www.singletonschreiber.com/theblog/how-environmental-racism-is-a-failure-of-environmental-policy-and-human-rights-violations)

### The Common Thread

**FACT:** Environmental hazards are consistently placed where land is cheap and residents have little political powerâwhich, due to historical segregation policies, means minority communities.

**FACT:** The Fair Housing Act (1968) made redlining illegal, but its effects persist. Research in 2020 found Black and Hispanic mortgage applicants still denied at higher rates than white and Asian applicants.

**Source:** [Urban Institute - Ghosts of Housing Discrimination](https://www.urban.org/stories/ghosts-housing-discrimination-reach-beyond-redlining)

> **ANALYSIS:** Environmental racism is not a series of coincidences but the predictable result of policies that concentrated poverty and stripped political power from minority communities. Pollution follows the path of least resistance, whichâby designâruns through Black and Indigenous neighborhoods.

## Wealth Inequality

**Historical Trends and Mechanisms**

### The Pattern

American wealth inequality follows a U-shape: extreme concentration in the Gilded Age, compression during the New Deal through 1970s, then rapid re-concentration since 1980. We are now in a "Second Gilded Age."

### The First Gilded Age (1870s-1910s)

**FACT:** Between 1860 and 1900, the wealthiest 10% owned approximately 75% of national wealth.

**FACT:** By 1897, the richest 4,000 families (less than 1% of the population) held as much wealth as the other 11.6 million families combined.

**FACT:** In Massachusetts, 1870-1900:
- Top 5% share: 57% â 70%
- Top 1% share: 27% â 37%

**Source:** [Inequality.org - The Gilded Age](https://inequality.org/article/the-gilded-age-then-the-gildest-age-now/)

**FACT:** The term "Gilded Age" (coined by Mark Twain, 1873) implies a thin layer of gold covering rot underneath.

### Failed Early Reforms

**FACT:** In 1894, the US attempted a 2% income tax on income over $4,000 (approximately $115,000 today). The Supreme Court struck it down as unconstitutional.

**FACT:** Income tax was considered "un-Democratic, inquisitorial, and wrong in principle."

**Source:** [TIME - The Gilded Age and American Income Inequality](https://time.com/5122375/american-inequality-gilded-age/)

### The Great Compression (1913-1970s)

**FACT:** The 16th Amendment (1913) allowed federal income tax.

**FACT:** Top 10% income share fell from 45-50% (1913) to 30-35% (1948)âknown as "The Great Compression."

**FACT:** Contributing factors:
- Progressive taxation
- New Deal programs
- Strong union membership
- WWII wage controls

**FACT:** Top marginal tax rates, 1944-1981: averaged 81%. Peak rate: 93%.

**FACT:** The 93% rate "essentially acted as a wage ceiling."

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Wealth Inequality in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States)

### The Mechanisms of Re-Concentration (1980s-Present)

**FACT:** Key policy changes:
- Top marginal rate: 70% (1979) â 37% (2021)
- Capital gains tax: 20% (top rate) vs. 37% (ordinary income)
- Deregulation of financial sector
- Weakening of unions

**Source:** [Economic Policy Institute - The New Gilded Age](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-new-gilded-age-income-inequality-in-the-u-s-by-state-metropolitan-area-and-county/)

**FACT:** Economist Joseph Stiglitz: "Strong unions have helped to reduce inequality, whereas weaker unions have made it easier for CEOs...to increase it."

**FACT:** The higher the income group, the larger the share from investment (capital) rather than wages (labor). This is taxed at lower rates.

### Citizens United and Political Inequality

**FACT:** *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010) struck down limits on corporate independent expenditures in elections.

**FACT:** The ruling created super PACs (unlimited contributions, unlimited spending) and fueled dark money (undisclosed donors).

**FACT:** Dark money: less than $5 million (2006) â over $1 billion in the 2024 presidential election alone.

**FACT:** President Obama: The decision "gives the special interests and their lobbyists even more power in Washington."

**FACT:** Former President Carter called the US "an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery."

### The Second Gilded Age (Today)

**FACT:** The IMF has called the current era the "Second Gilded Age."

**FACT:** Current distribution:
- Top 10%: own 62% of national wealth
- Bottom 50%: own 5.7%
- Top 0.01%: own 10% of national wealth (five times their share in late 1970s, higher than in 1913)

**FACT:** Wealth inequality today is "close to those observed at the beginning of the 20th century."

**Source:** [ABC News - We Are In A Second Gilded Age](https://abcnews.go.com/US/experts-gilded-age/story?id=115067246)

> **ANALYSIS:** Wealth concentration is not natural or inevitableâit was reduced by policy (progressive taxation, unions, regulations) and restored by different policies (tax cuts, deregulation, union-busting). The current inequality is a political choice, not an economic law.

## Media and Propaganda

**Manufacturing Consent: Yellow Journalism to Fox News**

### The Pattern

American media has always served power. The methods evolveâfrom yellow journalism's sensationalism to modern corporate media's structural biasesâbut the function remains: shaping public opinion to serve elite interests.

### Yellow Journalism (1890s)

**FACT:** The term "yellow journalism" originated in the 1890s circulation war between Joseph Pulitzer's *New York World* and William Randolph Hearst's *New York Journal*.

**FACT:** Characteristics: sensationalism, unverified claims, partisan agendas, focus on crime/scandal/violence.

**FACT:** Yellow journalism helped push the US into the Spanish-American War. When the USS Maine exploded in Havana harbor (likely an internal explosion), Hearst and Pulitzer published rumors of Spanish plots.

**FACT:** Hearst allegedly told an illustrator in Cuba: "You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war."

**Source:** [State Department - US Diplomacy and Yellow Journalism](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1866-1898/yellow-journalism)

### Manufacturing Consent (The Propaganda Model)

**FACT:** Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky's *Manufacturing Consent* (1988) argues that mass media function as "effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function."

**FACT:** The five "filters" of the propaganda model:
1. Concentrated corporate ownership and profit orientation
2. Advertising as primary revenue source
3. Reliance on government/corporate sources and "approved experts"
4. "Flak" (organized pressure) to discipline media
5. Anti-communism (later "war on terror") as control mechanism

**FACT:** The title references Walter Lippmann's *Public Opinion* (1922), which introduced the phrase "manufacture of consent."

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Manufacturing Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent)

### Modern Corporate Media Consolidation

**FACT:** Sinclair Broadcast Group:
- Second-largest TV station operator in the US
- Owns or operates 193 stations in 100+ markets
- Reaches 40% of American households
- Largest owner of stations affiliated with Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC

**FACT:** In 2018, Sinclair forced nearly 200 local news anchors to read the same script warning against "biased and false news"âa viral video showed them speaking in unison.

**FACT:** American University professor Jane Hall called it "a corporate piece of propaganda."

**FACT:** Sinclair's propaganda is particularly effective because Americans trust local news more than national networks.

**Source:** [NPR - Sinclair Broadcast Group Forces Anchors to Read Same Script](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/02/598916366/sinclair-broadcast-group-forces-nearly-200-station-anchors-to-read-same-script)

### Media Suppression of Labor History

**FACT:** After the 1937 Memorial Day Massacre, newsreel footage was suppressed "for fear of creating mass hysteria."

**FACT:** Major newspapers (Chicago Tribune, New York Times) initially portrayed the peaceful protesters as a violent mob and police as defenders.

**FACT:** The truth emerged only when Congressional investigation forced release of the footage.

**Source:** [Illinois Labor History Society - Memorial Day Massacre](http://www.illinoislaborhistory.org/labor-history-articles/memorial-day-massacre)

### The Fox News Effect

**FACT:** Fox News, founded 1996 by Roger Ailes (former Nixon media consultant), pioneered the 24-hour partisan news model.

**FACT:** Sinclair Broadcasting has been called "the truest heir to Roger Ailes's original vision of conservative news programming."

**FACT:** Hillary Clinton specifically called out Sinclair alongside Fox News for "delivering propaganda."

**Source:** [NBC News - Sinclair Broadcasting and Roger Ailes's Legacy](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/sinclair-broadcasting-not-fox-news-becoming-truest-heir-roger-ailes-ncna881146)

> **ANALYSIS:** The propaganda model explains why corporate media systematically favors corporate interestsânot through conspiracy but through structural incentives. Ownership, advertising revenue, and source dependence all push coverage in predictable directions. The consolidation of local media under companies like Sinclair demonstrates how propaganda can be delivered through trusted local channels.

## Education System and Historical Erasure

**How This History Gets Erased**

### The Pattern

American history education has been systematically shaped to erase or minimize: slavery's centrality, Indigenous genocide, labor struggles, and ongoing racial oppression. This is not accidentalâit was an organized campaign.

### The Lost Cause Campaign

**FACT:** The "Lost Cause" is a pseudohistorical myth arguing the Confederacy's cause was heroic, just, and not primarily about slavery. First articulated in 1866.

**FACT:** The United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) led a deliberate campaign to shape textbooks.

**FACT:** In 1919, the UDC's Rutherford Committee published "A Measuring Rod to Test Text Books," requiring textbooks to:
- Present the Constitution as a compact between sovereign states
- Not suggest the Confederacy fought to protect slavery
- Portray enslavers as benevolent

**Source:** [Facing South - How Confederate Propaganda Ended Up in Schoolbooks](https://www.facingsouth.org/2019/04/twisted-sources-how-confederate-propaganda-ended-souths-schoolbooks)

### How Publishers Complied

**FACT:** Southern states developed statewide textbook adoption policies, giving state committees power to reject books or demand changes.

**FACT:** Northern publishers began producing separate "Southern editions" reinforcing Lost Cause narratives, depicting enslaved people as "happy and content."

**FACT:** By 1940, the Lost Cause narrative dominated textbooks nationwideânot just in the South.

**Source:** [Georgia State University - Rewriting History: How the South Won the Textbook War](https://news.gsu.edu/research-magazine/rewriting-history-civil-war-textbooks)

### Specific Textbook Examples

**FACT:** Virginia (1957) commissioned textbooks stating:
- "Enslaved people were happy to be in Virginia and were better off than they would have been in Africa"
- "Abolitionists lied about slavery in the South"
- The Civil War was caused by Abraham Lincoln, not slavery

**FACT:** Texas (until 2019-2020): curriculum required teaching that slavery was a *tertiary* cause of the Civil War, behind "states' rights" and "sectionalism."

**FACT:** In 2015, a Texas geography textbook described enslaved people as "immigrants" and "workers." McGraw-Hill changed it only after public outcry.

**Source:** [TIME - The Civil War and America's Textbook Debate](https://time.com/5013943/john-kelly-civil-war-textbooks/)

### Challenges to the Lost Cause Narrative

**FACT:** In 1946, the NAACP began a nationwide textbook campaign.

**FACT:** The textbook industry didn't make significant changes until the 1970s.

**FACT:** In 1980, a lawsuit finally forced Mississippi to adopt "Conflict and Change"âthe first state-endorsed textbook departing from Lost Cause mythology.

**Source:** [The Daily Beast - How Dixie's History Got Whitewashed](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-dixies-history-got-whitewashed/)

### The 1619 Project Controversy

**FACT:** The 1619 Project (New York Times Magazine, 2019) aimed to "reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative."

**FACT:** As of January 2020, over 4,500 classrooms had adopted the Pulitzer Center curriculum based on the project.

**FACT:** At least five states (Iowa, South Dakota, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi) introduced legislation to ban teaching the 1619 Project or cut funding to schools that do.

**FACT:** Trump established the "1776 Commission" (November 2020) to create a "patriotic" counter-curriculum.

**Source:** [Education Week - Lawmakers Push to Ban 1619 Project](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/lawmakers-push-to-ban-1619-project-from-schools/2021/02)

**FACT:** The National Council for the Social Studies "resoundingly rejects any effort by the federal government to silence social studies curriculum that explicitly addresses the centrality of slavery."

**Source:** [Wikipedia - The 1619 Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_1619_Project)

### What Gets Erased

**FACT:** Topics systematically minimized or omitted from standard curricula:
- Scale and centrality of slavery to American wealth
- Indigenous genocide (estimated 90%+ population loss)
- Labor massacres (Haymarket, Ludlow, Blair Mountain, Memorial Day Massacre)
- US support for dictators abroad
- Ongoing effects of redlining and segregation
- Environmental racism

> **ANALYSIS:** The erasure of history is not passiveâit was and is an active project. The Lost Cause campaign shows how organized groups can shape collective memory across generations. Current battles over the 1619 Project, Critical Race Theory, and "patriotic education" are continuations of the same struggle over what history Americans are allowed to know.

## Overview

Voter suppression in the United States represents a continuous thread through American history, evolving in tactics but maintaining consistent goals: restricting access to the ballot for specific demographic groups, particularly racial minorities. This document traces that history from Reconstruction through the present day.

---

## Part I: Reconstruction Era (1865-1877)

### Constitutional Foundations

The post-Civil War period established the constitutional framework for Black voting rights through three critical amendments:

- **13th Amendment (1865)**: Abolished slavery
- **14th Amendment (1868)**: Granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States and guaranteed equal protection under the law
- **15th Amendment (1870)**: Prohibited the denial of voting rights based on "race, color, or previous condition of servitude"

### Black Political Power During Reconstruction

The immediate post-war period saw unprecedented Black political participation:

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| Black men elected to public office | Over 1,500 |
| African Americans serving in U.S. Congress | 16-20 |
| Black state legislators across South | 600+ |

**Key milestones:**
- **February 1870**: Hiram R. Revels of Mississippi became the first Black U.S. Senator, taking the seat vacated by Jefferson Davis in 1861
- **December 1870**: Joseph Rainey became the first Black member of the House of Representatives
- **1872**: Mississippi elected a Black speaker of the house (John R. Lynch)
- **South Carolina**: 210 African Americans served in the lower house and 29 in the state senate during Reconstruction

### Reconstruction Achievements

Black officeholders made significant contributions:
- Established first state-sponsored public schools in the South
- South Carolina's 1868 constitutional convention (majority Black delegates) created tax-funded public schools
- Louisiana's constitutional convention wrote integrated public schools into the state Constitution

### Violent Suppression

The Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations used terror to suppress Black political participation:

- **At least 35 Black officials were murdered** by the Klan and other white supremacist organizations during Reconstruction
- Violence included beatings, whippings, property destruction, and assassinations
- Night rides and intimidation campaigns targeted Black voters and Republican supporters
- Armed mobs appeared at polling places on election days

**Notable massacres:**
- Colfax, Louisiana (1873)
- Hamburg, South Carolina (1876)

### The Compromise of 1877

The contested 1876 presidential election between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tilden led to an informal deal:

**Terms:**
1. Hayes would become president
2. Federal troops would be withdrawn from Southern states (specifically Louisiana and South Carolina)
3. A Southerner would be appointed to Hayes's cabinet
4. Federal support for Southern infrastructure projects

**Consequences:**
- End of federal enforcement of Reconstruction policies
- "Redeemer" Democratic governments regained political control throughout the South
- Beginning of systematic disenfranchisement of Black voters
- Foundation laid for Jim Crow era

---

## Part II: Jim Crow Era (1877-1965)

### Poll Taxes

Poll taxes emerged as a primary disenfranchisement tool:

- **Georgia (1877)**: Implemented cumulative poll tax requiring payment of all back taxes before voting
  - Result: Black voter turnout dropped 50%
- **By 1904**: Every former Confederate state required some form of poll tax
- **Typical cost**: $1-2 per election (equivalent to significant portion of monthly wages for poor workers)

**Effectiveness:** In an era when $25/month supported an entire family, poll taxes presented substantial barriers to poor voters of both races.

### Literacy Tests

Beginning in the 1880s, literacy tests became voter registration requirements:

**Characteristics:**
- Arbitrary administration with inconsistent standards
- Disproportionately applied to Black voters
- A single wrong answer would disqualify voters
- Included trick questions and subjective interpretation requirements

**Mississippi 1890 Example:** Voters had to read any section of the Mississippi Constitution, understand any section when read aloud, or provide a "reasonable interpretation" of any section (at the discretion of white registrars).

**Source:** [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/elections/voters/african-americans/)

### Grandfather Clauses

Designed to protect illiterate white voters while excluding Black citizens:

**Mechanism:** If a citizen could prove their grandfather was registered to vote before the abolition of slavery, they could register regardless of literacy test results.

**Impact:** Since most African Americans' grandfathers were enslaved and could not vote, this loophole was unavailable to them.

**Legal status:** Seven southern states incorporated grandfather clauses into their state constitutions. The U.S. Supreme Court deemed them unconstitutional in **Guinn v. United States (1915)**.

**Source:** [EBSCO Research Starters](https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/law/grandfather-clauses)

### White Primaries

A system that excluded Black voters from the only elections that mattered in the one-party South:

**Implementation timeline:**
| State | Year Established |
|-------|-----------------|
| South Carolina | 1896 |
| Georgia | 1900 |
| Florida | 1902 |
| Mississippi | 1902 |
| Alabama | 1902 |
| Texas | 1905 |
| Louisiana | 1906 |
| Arkansas | 1906 |
| Virginia | 1912 |

**Rationale:** Democrats claimed their party was a private "club" that could exclude Black members, making the primary elections (which determined all winners in the one-party South) whites-only.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - White Primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_primary)

### Smith v. Allwright (1944)

**Background:** In 1940, Houston dentist Lonnie E. Smith was denied a ballot in the Democratic primary in Harris County, Texas.

**Supreme Court Ruling (8-1):**
- White primaries violated the 15th and 14th Amendments
- Primary elections are an integral part of the electoral process subject to constitutional protections
- When states delegate authority to political parties, those parties perform public functions and must comply with constitutional requirements

**Impact:**
- Black voter registration rose from 200,000 (1940) to 800,000 (1948) to over 1 million (1952)
- Described as "the watershed in the struggle for Black rights"

**Source:** [NAACP Legal Defense Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/case-issue/landmark-smith-v-allwright/)

### Statistical Impact of Jim Crow

**Black voter registration rates in the South:**

| Year | Registration Rate |
|------|------------------|
| 1940 | Less than 3% |
| 1960 | 29% |
| 1964 | Over 40% |

**State-specific devastation:**
- **Mississippi (1892)**: Black male voter registration dropped from 90% to 6%
- **Louisiana**: Registered Black voters dropped from 130,334 (1896) to 1,342 (1904) - a 99% reduction
- **Alabama (early 1960s)**: Only 19.4% of African Americans registered
- **Mississippi (early 1960s)**: Only 6.4% of African Americans registered

## Part III: Voting Rights Act of 1965

### What the VRA Did

The Voting Rights Act of 1965, signed by President Lyndon Johnson, outlawed discriminatory voting practices:

**Key provisions:**
- Banned literacy tests
- Prohibited poll taxes in state elections (federal poll taxes already banned by 24th Amendment, 1964)
- Eliminated grandfather clauses
- Authorized federal oversight of voter registration
- Created preclearance requirement (Section 5)

**Source:** [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act)

### Section 5: Preclearance

**Mechanism:** Required certain jurisdictions with histories of discrimination to obtain federal approval before implementing any voting changes.

**Covered jurisdictions (1965):**
- Alabama (entire state)
- Georgia (entire state)
- Louisiana (entire state)
- Mississippi (entire state)
- South Carolina (entire state)
- Virginia (entire state)
- 39 counties in North Carolina

**Subsequent expansions:** Coverage formula extended to include data from 1968 and 1972 elections, eventually covering parts of 16 states including Alaska, Arizona, and counties in California, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, and North Dakota.

**Source:** [Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/preclearance-under-voting-rights-act)

### Immediate Impact

**Registration surge:**
- By end of 1965: 250,000 new Black voters registered (one-third by federal examiners)
- By end of 1966: Only 4 of 13 southern states had fewer than 50% of African Americans registered

**State transformations:**
| State | Before VRA | After VRA (1966) |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Alabama | 11% | 51% |
| Tennessee | 27% | 72% |

**Long-term success:**
- Black registration rates in former Confederate states rose from 30 points below white registration (1960) to equal or greater than white rates (2010)
- African Americans in Congress grew from 5 (1965) to 48 (recent)
- Black elected officials nationwide increased from fewer than 1,000 to over 10,000

**Assessment:** According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the VRA is "the most effective piece of federal civil rights legislation ever enacted."

## Part IV: Modern Voter Suppression (2000-2013)

### Florida 2000: The Felon Purge

**Background:** Florida's felon disenfranchisement law dated to 1868, originally designed to target newly emancipated African Americans.

**The purge operation:**
- Secretary of State Katherine Harris contracted Database Technologies Inc. (DBT) for $2.3 million to create a "scrub list"
- DBT used an 70-80% name-match criterion, guaranteed to produce false positives
- Total names on purge list: 82,389 voters

**Racial disparities:**
- Black voters: 11% of registered voters but 44% of purge list
- Thousands of eligible voters incorrectly labeled as felons

**Election impact:**
- Bush defeated Gore by 537 votes
- U.S. Civil Rights Commission calculation: If 12,000 voters were wrongly purged, 44% were African American, and 90% of African Americans voted for Gore, approximately 4,752 Black Gore voters could have been prevented from voting - nearly 9 times Bush's margin of victory

**Commission findings:** "Strong and credible evidence of violations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the disenfranchisement of people of color."

### Photo Voter ID Laws: The New Wave

**Timeline of proliferation:**
- **1950**: South Carolina first required non-photo ID
- **2005**: Indiana passed first strict photo voter ID requirement
- **2005**: Georgia passed strict voter ID (delayed by courts until 2008)
- **2008**: Crawford v. Marion County Election Board - Supreme Court upheld Indiana law
- **2011-2012**: Wave of new laws (Wisconsin, Ohio, Kansas, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas)

**Statistics:**
- Since 2001: Nearly 1,000 voter ID bills introduced in 46 states
- 2012: Voter ID legislation introduced in 32 states

**Carter-Baker Commission (2005):** Bipartisan commission recommended voter ID with free ID cards and mobile ID vans for underserved communities - recommendations largely ignored in subsequent legislation.

## Part V: Shelby County v. Holder (2013)

### The Decision

**Date:** June 25, 2013

**Ruling (5-4):** Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional because the coverage formula was based on data over 40 years old.

**Key distinction:** The Court did not rule Section 5 unconstitutional but invalidated the formula determining which jurisdictions were covered, rendering Section 5 unenforceable.

**Immediate effect:** Jurisdictions previously covered no longer needed preclearance for voting changes.

**Source:** [Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/shelby-county-v-holder)

### Immediate Aftermath

**Same day (June 25, 2013):**
- Texas Attorney General announced previously blocked strict voter ID law would take effect immediately

**Within two months:**
- North Carolina passed "monster voter suppression law" (HB 589) including:
  - Strict photo ID requirement
  - Reduced early voting from 17 to 10 days
  - Eliminated same-day registration
  - Banned out-of-precinct provisional voting
  - Ended pre-registration for 16-year-olds

### Texas Voter ID Law (SB 14)

**History:**
- Blocked by federal government in 2012 under preclearance for discriminatory impact
- Implemented immediately after Shelby County decision

**Court rulings:**
- October 2014: Federal judge struck down law as "unconstitutional poll tax"
- July 2016: Fifth Circuit ruled (9-6) law violated VRA, discriminating against Black and Hispanic voters
- Court found 600,000 Texans lacked required ID

**Source:** [The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights](https://civilrights.org/2017/04/11/texas-voter-id-law-ruled-intentionally-discriminatory/)

### North Carolina HB 589 Struck Down

**Fourth Circuit ruling (July 2016):** Law targeted "African Americans with almost surgical precision."

**Evidence:** Republican lawmakers had requested data on voting practices broken down by race, then restricted practices disproportionately used by Black voters.

**Specific finding:** Early voting cuts targeted first week specifically because more African Americans voted during that week.

**Impact data:** Between 2008-2012, 70% of African American voters in NC voted early. After cuts, Black early voting turnout dropped 8.7% (approximately 66,000 votes).

**Source:** [Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/states-have-added-nearly-100-restrictive-laws-scotus-gutted-voting-rights)

### Cumulative Impact of Shelby County

**Restrictive laws passed:**
- 2013-2016: At least 17 restrictive voting laws
- 2017-2020: At least 27 restrictive voting laws
- Total since Shelby County: At least 94 restrictive laws in 29 states

**Voter purge increases:** Median purge rate in previously covered jurisdictions increased 40% compared to non-covered jurisdictions.

**Racial turnout gap:** Growing almost twice as quickly in formerly covered regions. By 2022 elections, white-Black turnout gap in formerly covered regions was 5 percentage points higher than it would have been with VRA intact.

## Part VI: Post-Shelby Suppression Tactics

### Exact Match Laws

**Georgia's "Exact Match" (2017):**
- Required voter registration applications to precisely match DMV or Social Security databases
- Non-matches resulted from minor errors: missing hyphen, typo in license number, "John" vs. "Johnathan"

**Impact (2018 election):**
- 53,000 registrations flagged as "pending"
- 70% of flagged voters were Black (Georgia is 32% Black)
- 80% of voters blocked by exact match were people of color

**Source:** [APM Reports](https://www.apmreports.org/story/2019/10/29/georgia-voting-registration-records-removed)

### Voter Roll Purges

**Georgia under Brian Kemp (2012-2018):**
- 1.4 million voter registrations cancelled
- 670,000 registrations cancelled in 2017 alone
- July 2017: 560,000 Georgians removed in single day under "use-it-or-lose-it" policy
- APM Reports estimated 107,000 purged voters would otherwise have been eligible in 2018

**National pattern:** Formerly covered jurisdictions showed 40% higher purge rates than other areas after Shelby County.

### Polling Place Closures

**Leadership Conference Education Fund Report (2019):**
Total closures in 13 states (2012-2018): **1,688 polling locations**
- 1,173 closures occurred between 2014 and 2018 midterms

|-------|----------|-------|
| Texas | 750 | Most closures of any state |
| Arizona | 320 | 13 of 15 counties closed locations |
| Georgia | 214 | Highest percentage closures |

**County-level data:**
- Maricopa County, AZ: 171 closures (most of any county)
- Dallas County, TX: 74 closures
- Travis County, TX: 67 closures
- Harris County, TX: 52 closures

**Georgia specifics:**
- Top closers by percentage: Lumpkin (89%), Stephens (88%), Warren (83%)
- 15 of 159 counties left with only one precinct
- Estimated 54,000-85,000 voters prevented from voting in 2018 due to increased distance
- Black voters 20% more likely than whites to miss election due to closures

**Source:** [Leadership Conference Education Fund - Democracy Diverted](https://civilrights.org/democracy-diverted/)

### Early Voting Restrictions

**Ohio:** Eliminated "golden week" (overlapping registration and early voting period)
- 2012: 80,000 people used golden week (1.4% of ballots)
- Black voters 5x more likely to use golden week than white voters (2012)

**North Carolina:** Cut early voting from 17 to 10 days
- Fourth Circuit found this targeted Black voters who disproportionately used first week

## Part VIII: Who Is Targeted

### Racial Disparities

**Voter ID impact studies:**
- Latino voter turnout: 10.3 percentage points lower in strict photo ID states
- Multi-racial American turnout: 12.8 percentage points lower
- Racial turnout gap widened when states enacted strict voter ID laws

**Wait times:**
- Voters of color consistently face longer wait times
- Cell phone data confirms longer waits in minority neighborhoods
- Polling places with fewer white voters have more slowdowns

**Mail ballot rejection rates:**
- Black voter mail ballots rejected at higher rates than white voters (Georgia 2020 primary, Georgia/Florida 2018 general)

**Felony disenfranchisement:**
- 5.3 million Americans disenfranchised (2.3% of voting age population)
- Over one-third are Black
- Black inmates: 40% of prison population but 13.4% of general population

**Source:** [Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/impact-voter-suppression-communities-color)

### Student Voters

**ID restrictions:**
- States banning student IDs entirely: North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Idaho (2024)
- Georgia: Only public college IDs valid (excludes 7 of 10 HBCUs)
- Arizona: Only public college IDs with addresses (no public universities include addresses)
- Wisconsin: Required signatures and two-year expiration dates

**Campus polling closures:**
- Iowa: Law prevents satellite voting in state-owned buildings
- Florida: Parking requirements effectively ban campus polling places
- Texas: Legislation introduced to ban campus polling entirely
- Duke study: 90% of campuses had no early voting options

**Source:** [League of Women Voters](https://www.lwv.org/blog/challenges-facing-student-voters)

### Native American Voters

**Address requirements:**
- Many reservation residents lack traditional street addresses
- Roads may not have names; homes may not have numbers
- Mail delivery often through P.O. boxes at tribal offices

**North Dakota (Brakebill v. Jaeger):**
- Strict ID law requiring residential street address
- Many Native Americans on reservations lack such addresses
- Prominent issue in 2018 midterms

**Additional barriers:**
- Lack of state-issued IDs
- Distance to DMV offices in rural areas
- Difficulty obtaining documentation for ID applications

### Urban vs. Rural Access

**Polling place disparities:**
- Urban areas (higher minority populations) more likely to see closures
- Wait times consistently longer in urban minority neighborhoods
- Rural areas often have more polling places per capita

## Part IX: ALEC and Coordinated Strategy

### American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)

**Background:** Founded 1973, ALEC operates as a "bill mill" connecting corporate interests with state legislators.

**Voter ID model legislation:**
- 2009: ALEC's Public Safety and Elections Task Force approved "Voter ID Act"
- Model based on Indiana and Georgia laws
- States adopting ALEC-style laws: Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin

**Corporate involvement:**
- Dues-paying members include Koch Industries, Walmart, Coca-Cola
- Corporations pay fees for access to legislators
- Joint drafting of model legislation

**Source:** [ALEC Exposed](https://www.alecexposed.org/wiki/ALEC_&_Voting_Rights)

### Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action

**Election Integrity Scorecard:**
- First published December 14, 2021
- Ranks states based on Heritage's "best practices"
- Top-scoring states: Tennessee (90), Alabama/Florida/Georgia (83)
- Provides model legislation to state legislators

**$24 Million Plan (Leaked 2021):**

**Target states:** Arizona, Michigan, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada, Texas, Wisconsin

**Strategy revealed in leaked video:**
- Heritage Action executive director Jessica Anderson boasted of influence
- Georgia SB 202: "Eight key provisions that Heritage recommended"
- Texas legislation: "19 provisions" from Heritage
- Iowa: "We did it quickly and we did it quietly. We helped draft the bills"
- Method: "In some cases, we actually draft them for them"

**"Sentinel" network:** Local activists trained to call legislators, attend hearings, provide testimony for restrictive legislation.

  4. Early voting cuts
  5. Polling place closures
- SB 202 (2021) added additional restrictions
- Historical leader in percentage of polling places closed

**Texas:**
- 750 polling places closed (most of any state)

## Conclusion

The history of voter suppression in America demonstrates a continuous pattern of adaptation. When one method of disenfranchisement is blocked, new tactics emerge:

- **Reconstruction violence** gave way to **Jim Crow laws**
- **Jim Crow mechanisms** were dismantled by the **Voting Rights Act**
- **VRA preclearance** was gutted by **Shelby County**
- **Post-Shelby** saw immediate implementation of previously blocked measures

The current era represents a new phase in this history, characterized by:
1. Coordinated multi-state legislation through organizations like ALEC and Heritage Action
2. Sophisticated use of data to target specific demographics
3. Multiple overlapping restrictions (ID + purges + closures + mail restrictions)
4. Diminished federal oversight capacity

Understanding this history is essential for recognizing current patterns and their historical antecedents.

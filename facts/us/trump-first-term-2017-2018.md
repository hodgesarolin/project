## Inauguration and the "American Carnage" Speech

### Date: January 20, 2017

Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States on Friday, January 20, 2017, at the West Front of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.

### The Speech

Trump's inaugural address was notably dark compared to predecessors. He depicted the United States in dystopian terms:

> "Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential."

The key phrase that would define the speech:

> **"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now."**

### Analysis

The speech was a fiery nationalist manifesto promising a populist restoration by stripping power from Washington's elites. In 16 mostly harsh, mostly confrontational minutes, Trump laid out a view of America that alienated his predecessors. It may go down as one of the most consequential - or misleading - speeches in the history of presidential inaugurations.

George W. Bush reportedly said after the speech: "That was some weird shit."

## Crowd Size Controversy

### Date: January 21-22, 2017

The crowd-size controversy began on Saturday, January 21, 2017, one day after the inauguration, when Trump claimed the media had misrepresented attendance.

### Trump's Claims

Trump traveled to the CIA on January 21 and told intelligence officers he believed there were "anywhere between 1 million and 1.5 million people" on the National Mall.

### Sean Spicer's Statement

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer held a brief news conference, reportedly at Trump's insistence, declaring:

> **"This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration - period - both in person and around the globe."**

This was rated as false by multiple fact-checkers.

### The Evidence

| Metric | Trump 2017 | Obama 2009 | Obama 2013 |
|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| Metro ridership (by 11am) | 193,000 | 513,000 | 317,000 |
| Metro ridership (full day) | 570,557 | 1,100,000 | 782,000 |
| TV viewers | 30.6 million | 37.8 million | N/A |
| Estimated crowd | 300,000-600,000 | 1.1-1.8 million | N/A |

### Expert Analysis

G. Keith Still, a renowned crowd scientist and visiting professor at the University of Suffolk, concluded that Trump's 2017 crowd was **about one-third the size** of Obama's 2009 audience.

### "Alternative Facts"

On January 22, 2017, Kellyanne Conway defended Spicer's statements by saying he had offered "alternative facts" - a phrase that became widely mocked and symbolic of the administration's relationship with truth.

### Why No Official Count Exists

The National Park Service was taken out of the crowd-counting business after a controversy over the 1995 Million Man March. The NPS stopped giving crowd-size estimates for events on the Mall in 1996.

### Long-term Significance

The crowd-size dispute set the tone for the administration's combative relationship with media and facts. Trump's preoccupation with crowd sizes would persist throughout his presidency.

## Travel Ban / Muslim Ban

### Executive Order 13769 - "Travel Ban 1.0"

**Date Signed:** January 27, 2017

Formally titled "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States," this executive order:

- **Banned** citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries (Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen) from entering the United States for 90 days
- **Indefinitely suspended** entry of Syrian refugees
- **Suspended** all refugee admissions for 120 days
- **Lowered** the 2017 refugee cap from 110,000 to 50,000

### Immediate Chaos

- Over **700 travelers were detained** at airports
- Up to **60,000 visas were "provisionally revoked"**
- Approximately **50 lawsuits** were filed
- Protests erupted at airports nationwide

### Legal Challenges

**January 28, 2017:** Federal judge in New York granted ACLU's request for an emergency stay to prevent deportations of those stranded in airports.

**February 3, 2017:** Federal Judge James Robart in Washington issued a nationwide temporary restraining order (TRO).

**February 9, 2017:** Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the TRO in *Washington v. Trump*.

### Executive Order 13780 - "Travel Ban 2.0"

**Date Signed:** March 6, 2017

Key differences from the original:
- Removed Iraq from the list
- Permitted entry to persons with valid visas
- Continued 120-day refugee suspension but dropped indefinite Syrian ban
- Scheduled to take effect in 10 days

**March 15, 2017:** Judge Derrick Watson (Hawaii) issued TRO, finding the order was likely motivated by anti-Muslim sentiment.

**March 16, 2017:** Judge Theodore Chuang (Maryland) issued preliminary injunction.

### Supreme Court Ruling

**June 26, 2018:** The Supreme Court upheld the travel ban in *Trump v. Hawaii* (5-4 decision), endorsing presidential authority over immigration.

### Campaign Promise Context

During the campaign, Trump called for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" on December 7, 2015. Courts cited this statement in finding discriminatory intent.

### End of the Ban

**January 20, 2021:** President Biden revoked the travel ban via Presidential Proclamation 10141 on his first day in office.

## Michael Flynn Resignation

### Date: February 13, 2017 (24 days into administration)

National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resigned after revelations that he had lied about his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

### The Controversy

Flynn had privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Kislyak during the transition period, before Trump took office. This was interpreted as an inappropriate signal that Russia could expect relief from Obama-era sanctions imposed for election interference.

### The Kislyak Calls

**December 29, 2016:** The Obama administration announced sweeping sanctions on Russian intelligence agencies for election interference.

That same day, Flynn called Kislyak and "requested that Russia not escalate the situation and only respond to the U.S. sanctions in a reciprocal manner." Kislyak agreed Russia would "moderate its response" as a result of Flynn's request.

### Why Flynn Resigned

- **January 24, 2017:** Flynn was interviewed by the FBI and lied about his contacts with Kislyak
- **January 26, 2017:** DOJ officials (including Sally Yates) warned the White House that Flynn had misled officials and was potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia
- **February 13, 2017:** Flynn resigned, acknowledging he "inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information"

### Record-Setting Tenure

Michael Flynn's tenure as National Security Advisor (24 days) was the shortest in the history of the position.

### Later Developments

- **December 1, 2017:** Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents, becoming the first Trump administration official charged in the Mueller probe
- **2020:** DOJ moved to dismiss charges; case became politically contentious
- **December 2020:** Trump pardoned Flynn

## Jeff Sessions Recusal

### Date: March 2, 2017

Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced he would recuse himself from any investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign, including Russian interference.

### Background

**March 1, 2017:** The Washington Post reported that Sessions had met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in 2016, which he had not disclosed during his confirmation hearings.

During his confirmation, when asked about contacts with Russians, Sessions had said: "I did not have communications with the Russians."

### The Announcement

Sessions announced at a DOJ press conference:

> "I have decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States... I should not be involved in investigating a campaign I had a role in."

### Key Points

- Sessions cited his role as chairman of Trump's national security committee, not the Kislyak meetings, as the reason
- DOJ ethics officials had recommended recusal
- Oversight of the Russia investigation transferred to Deputy Attorney General (Rod Rosenstein, once confirmed)

### Trump's Reaction

Sessions' recusal infuriated Trump. The President believed Sessions should have protected him and later called the recusal a betrayal.

Trump publicly attacked Sessions repeatedly, calling him "beleaguered" and questioning why he took the job.

### Long-term Consequences

- Sessions' recusal directly led to Rod Rosenstein's authority to appoint Special Counsel Robert Mueller
- Trump's anger at Sessions continued until he fired Sessions on November 7, 2018, the day after the midterm elections

## Firing of James Comey

### Date: May 9, 2017

President Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey while Comey was in Los Angeles.

### Official Justification

The White House initially claimed Trump fired Comey based on recommendations from Attorney General Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, citing Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

Trump's letter to Comey stated: "It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission."

### Trump's Admission

**May 10, 2017:** In an interview with NBC's Lester Holt, Trump contradicted the official explanation:

> "When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.'"

This admission would become central to obstruction of justice questions.

### Key Context

- **March 20, 2017:** Comey publicly confirmed the FBI was investigating Russian interference and possible links to the Trump campaign
- **Early May 2017:** Comey reportedly asked DOJ for increased funding and personnel for the Russia probe
- **May 3, 2017:** Comey testified before Senate Judiciary Committee, saying it made him "mildly nauseous" to think his actions may have influenced the 2016 election

### The "Loyalty Dinner"

According to Comey's later testimony, at a private dinner on January 27, 2017, Trump asked Comey for his "loyalty." Comey offered "honesty" instead.

### The Flynn Request

**February 14, 2017:** According to Comey's memo, Trump cleared the Oval Office to speak with Comey alone and said regarding Michael Flynn: "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy."

### Comey's Response

Shortly after his termination, Comey asked a friend to share excerpts from his memos with the press, hoping to prompt appointment of a special counsel. This strategy succeeded.

### Comparisons to Watergate

The firing was immediately compared to the "Saturday Night Massacre" - President Nixon's termination of special prosecutor Archibald Cox during Watergate.

## Mueller Investigation Begins

### Date: May 17, 2017

Eight days after Comey's firing, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert S. Mueller III as Special Counsel.

### The Appointment

Rosenstein appointed Mueller "to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election," including:

- Any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign
- Any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation
- Any other matters within the scope of 28 CFR 600.4(a)

### Mueller's Background

Mueller was a registered Republican who had served as FBI Director from 2001-2013, under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

### Congressional Pressure

Over 130 Democratic lawmakers had called for a special counsel following Comey's firing. The appointment came days after reports that Trump had asked Comey to end the Flynn investigation.

### Key 2017 Developments

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| June 14, 2017 | Washington Post reports Mueller investigating Trump for possible obstruction |
| July 27, 2017 | George Papadopoulos secretly arrested |
| October 5, 2017 | Papadopoulos pleads guilty (sealed) |
| October 30, 2017 | Manafort and Gates indicted on 12 counts |
| October 30, 2017 | Papadopoulos plea unsealed |
| December 1, 2017 | Flynn pleads guilty to lying to FBI |

### Investigation Duration

The investigation lasted from May 17, 2017 to March 22, 2019 (nearly two years).

### Final Statistics

- **34 individuals** indicted or pleaded guilty
- **3 Russian companies** charged
- **7 guilty pleas** from Trump associates

## Charlottesville and "Very Fine People"

### Dates: August 11-12, 2017

The "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia became one of the most significant racial flashpoints of Trump's presidency.

### The Rally

White nationalists, neo-Nazis, and members of the alt-right gathered to protest the planned removal of a Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee. The rally was organized by Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler, both white nationalists.

**August 11:** Marchers carried tiki torches through the University of Virginia campus chanting "Jews will not replace us" and "Blood and soil."

**August 12:** Violence erupted between rally participants and counter-protesters.

### The Attack

**2:00 PM, August 12:** James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old neo-Nazi from Ohio, deliberately drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.

**Casualties:**
- **1 killed:** Heather Heyer, 32-year-old paralegal and civil rights activist
- **35 injured**

The attack was classified as domestic terrorism by the mayor of Charlottesville, Virginia's public safety secretary, the U.S. Attorney General, and the FBI Director.

### Trump's Initial Response (August 12)

Trump condemned violence "on many sides":

> "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides."

Critics noted his failure to specifically condemn white supremacists.

### Trump's Second Statement (August 14)

Under pressure, Trump read a prepared statement:

> "Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups."

### The Press Conference (August 15)

The following day, Trump held a press conference ostensibly about infrastructure but was asked about Charlottesville:

> "You had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides."

And:

> "Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch."

He added in a later response: "I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally."

### White Supremacist Response

David Duke, former KKK Grand Wizard, thanked Trump on Twitter: "Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa."

### Context Often Omitted

While Trump did say "I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists," the Unite the Right rally was explicitly organized by white nationalists. The "very fine people" distinction relied on a premise that ordinary citizens were there to protest statue removal alongside the neo-Nazis.

### James Fields Conviction

- **December 2018:** Convicted of first-degree murder and eight counts of malicious wounding
- **State sentence:** Life in prison plus 419 years
- **Federal charges:** Pleaded guilty to 29 federal hate crime charges
- **Federal sentence:** Additional life sentence

### Long-term Impact

The "very fine people" quote became a recurring flashpoint. Joe Biden cited it as a motivation for his 2020 presidential run.

## Hurricane Maria Response

### Date: September 20, 2017 (Hurricane landfall)

Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, becoming the deadliest natural disaster in the island's history.

### The Storm

- **Wind gusts:** Over 100 mph
- **Storm surge:** Massive
- **Rainfall:** Very heavy
- **Power:** Entire island lost electricity

### Death Toll Controversy

**Initial government figure:** 64 deaths

**Revised official figure (August 2018):** 2,975 deaths

The George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health conducted an independent study finding that 22% more people died during the six months after the storm than would have had the hurricane not struck.

### Trump's Visit (October 3, 2017)

Trump visited Puerto Rico and held a briefing where he:

- Compared Maria to "a real catastrophe like Katrina" (implying Maria was less serious)
- Praised the low death count (then 16)
- **Threw paper towels** into the crowd at a church distribution center

Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress, said of the paper towel incident: "I would not have done that."

### Trump's Statements

At the briefing, Trump said:

> "Every death is a horror, but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with really a storm that was just totally overpowering, nobody's ever seen anything like this... Sixteen people versus in the thousands."

### Response Criticism

The federal response had significant deficiencies:

- Maria was the third major hurricane in quick succession, leaving FEMA stretched thin
- **54% of FEMA staff** in October 2017 were serving in capacities for which they were not qualified
- Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands weren't prepared for a Category 5 hit
- Logistics were complicated by Puerto Rico's island location

### Federal Aid Delays

The Trump administration would later stall **$20 billion in hurricane relief** for Puerto Rico that Congress had approved.

### Trump's Death Toll Denial (September 2018)

When the revised death toll of 2,975 was released, Trump rejected it:

> "3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico... This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible."

He provided no evidence for this claim.

### Ongoing Problems (as of 2018)

- **60,000 homes** still had makeshift roofs
- **13%** of municipalities lacked stable phone or internet service
- Blackouts remained common

- **Congressional Budget Office:** $4.6 trillion if extended beyond sunset dates

### Distribution of Benefits

According to the Tax Policy Center:
- **65%** of households received tax cuts
- **6%** of households saw tax increases
- Higher income households received larger cuts as percentage of after-tax income
- Largest cuts went to taxpayers in the 95th to 99th percentiles

### Economic Effects

**GDP Growth:**
- GDP grew at the same rate in first two years after the cut as in last two years before
- Grew at 2.4% per year vs. predicted 1.7% under pre-TCJA baselines
- 0.5% increase in annual growth rate 2017-2018, not out of line with normal fluctuations

**Corporate Effects:**
- In 2018, over 90 Fortune 500 companies paid an effective federal tax rate of 0% or less
- Studies found tariffs imposed around same time offset investment gains

**Distribution:**
- Based on evidence through 2019, TCJA clearly raised federal debt and increased after-tax incomes
- Disproportionately increased incomes for the most affluent
- Effects on GDP and median wages "seem modest at best"

### Sunset Provisions

Most individual provisions were scheduled to expire ("sunset") by end of 2025, though in 2025 Congress passed extensions.

## Attacks on Media

### "Fake News" and "Enemy of the People"

Trump's attacks on the press were a defining feature of his presidency, beginning immediately after taking office.

### Timeline of Key Attacks

**January 11, 2017:** At first press conference as president-elect, Trump called BuzzFeed "a failing pile of garbage" and refused to take a question from CNN, calling them "fake news."

**February 17, 2017:** First use of "enemy of the people" language:

> "The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"

### Origin of the Phrase

Former senior White House officials pointed to Steve Bannon as having coined the term. Bannon said: "I think it's safe to say that we both came up with it in discussion... I think I threw out 'opposition media party' first, and then he threw out 'fake news is the enemy of the people.'"

### Statistics

From inauguration (January 2017) through October 2019:
- Trump called news media "enemy of the people" **36 times** on Twitter
- Highest percentage of anti-press tweets: January 2017 (15%), February 2017 (19%), March 2017 (17%)
- These were in response to reports about Russian hacking, administration infighting, and tax return leaks

### Historical Context

Historians noted the troubling precedent of the phrase. Twentieth-century dictators - notably Stalin, Hitler, and Mao - had denounced critics and press as "enemies of the people." Their goal was to delegitimize the press and create confusion about what's real.

### Impact

Trump's attacks correlated with declining trust in media among his supporters. Journalists reported increased harassment and threats.

## Paris Climate Agreement Withdrawal

### Date: June 1, 2017 (announcement)

Trump announced his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.

### Trump's Stated Reasons

> "The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense. They don't put America first. I do, and I always will."

Trump claimed compliance could cost 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 and 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs.

### Withdrawal Process

Under Article 28 of the Paris Agreement, withdrawal takes effect one year after notification:
- **November 4, 2019:** U.S. notified UN Secretary General
- **November 4, 2020:** Withdrawal took effect

### Environmental Policy Rollbacks

The administration rolled back more than 100 environmental regulations, including:
- Fuel efficiency standards for cars
- Power plant emission restrictions
- Coal restrictions

### State-Level Response

- 30 U.S. states and many cities committed to uphold Paris Agreement objectives despite federal withdrawal
- California and other states continued implementing climate programs

### International Response

- France, Germany, and Italy indicated they would increase climate efforts
- Japan's Foreign Ministry called the choice "regrettable"
- No other country withdrew following the U.S. departure

### Public Opinion

Washington Post/ABC News poll (June 2-4, 2017):
- **59%** opposed withdrawal
- **28%** supported withdrawal
- Sharp partisan divide: 67% of Republicans supported, 8% of Democrats supported

## Transgender Military Ban

### Date: July 26, 2017 (announcement)

Trump announced via Twitter that transgender individuals would be barred from military service.

### The Tweets

> "After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military."

> "Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."

### Context

- **June 2016:** Obama's Defense Secretary Ashton Carter had lifted the ban on transgender service members
- The military was given one year to implement the policy allowing transgender service

### Pentagon Response

Despite Trump's claim of consulting "my Generals," the Pentagon was caught off guard by the tweets. American Oversight obtained emails showing senior Pentagon leaders were unaware of the announcement before it happened, with one military official saying "everyone was caught flat-footed."

### Bipartisan Criticism

Several Republican senators spoke out against the announcement:
- John McCain
- Orrin Hatch
- Joni Ernst (Army veteran)
- Richard Shelby

### Legal Challenges

**August 9, 2017:** Five transgender service members filed *Jane Doe v. Trump*

Four separate federal courts blocked implementation:

Judge Marsha J. Pechman wrote: "The prohibition on military service by transgender individuals was announced by President Trump on Twitter, abruptly and without any evidence of considered reason or deliberation."

### Implementation

- **January 22, 2019:** Supreme Court allowed the ban to take effect
- **April 12, 2019:** Policy officially implemented
- **January 25, 2021:** Biden signed executive order repealing the ban

## Family Separation Policy

### Date: April-June 2018 (peak implementation)

The Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy resulted in the separation of thousands of children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.

### Policy Background

Family separations actually began in summer 2017, before the public announcement.

**April 6, 2018:** Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced "zero tolerance" for illegal border crossing.

**May 7, 2018:** DOJ formally implemented the policy across the entire border.

Under zero tolerance, all adults apprehended crossing illegally were prosecuted, with **no exception for asylum seekers or those with minor children**.

### Statistics

| Timeframe | Children Separated |
|-----------|-------------------|
| May 5 - June 9, 2018 | 2,342 |
| April 19 - May 31, 2018 | 1,995 |
| Before June 20, 2018 order | Nearly 3,000 |
| Total including post-policy | 5,300-5,500 |
| DHS 2021 final count | 5,636 |

**Rate:** 65 children separated per day during peak implementation.

### No Reunification Plan

By early June 2018, it emerged that the policy **did not include measures to reunite the families** it had separated.

Scott Lloyd, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, had directed his staff **not to maintain a list** of children who had been separated from their parents.

### Public Reaction and Policy End

Following widespread criticism - including from some Republicans, religious leaders, and former First Ladies of both parties - Trump signed an executive order on **June 20, 2018** mandating that DHS maintain custody of alien families together during proceedings.

### Reunification Efforts

**June 2021:** Biden's reunification task force reported:
- 3,913 children identified as separated under zero tolerance
- 1,786 had been reunited
- **2,127 children** had not been reunited with families

### Long-term Consequences

- Multiple court cases ongoing
- Psychological trauma documented among separated children
- Some parents deported without their children
- Some children still not reunited as of 2023

## Kavanaugh Supreme Court Nomination

### Timeline

**July 9, 2018:** Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy.

**September 4-7, 2018:** Initial confirmation hearings.

**September 16, 2018:** Washington Post revealed Christine Blasey Ford as Kavanaugh's accuser.

**September 27, 2018:** Ford and Kavanaugh testified before Senate Judiciary Committee.

**October 6, 2018:** Kavanaugh confirmed 50-48.

### The Allegation

Christine Blasey Ford, a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University, alleged that in the early 1980s, when she and Kavanaugh were teenagers at a house party in Maryland:

- Kavanaugh and classmate Mark Judge "corralled" her in a bedroom
- Kavanaugh pinned her to the bed, groped her, ground against her
- He tried to pull off her clothes and covered her mouth when she tried to scream

Ford had initially written to Senator Dianne Feinstein on July 30, 2018, requesting confidentiality.

### The Hearing

**September 27, 2018:** More than 20 million people watched the testimony on television.

Ford testified she was "100 percent" certain Kavanaugh was her attacker.

Kavanaugh angrily denied the allegations, calling the process "a calculated and orchestrated political hit."

### Other Allegations

Two additional women came forward with allegations:
- Deborah Ramirez alleged Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a Yale party
- Julie Swetnick made claims about parties involving Kavanaugh (later questioned)

### FBI Investigation

Republicans agreed to a supplemental FBI investigation, limited to one week.

Critics argued the investigation was too narrow; the FBI reportedly did not interview Ford or Kavanaugh.

### Confirmation Vote

**October 6, 2018:** Confirmed 50-48

- One Republican (Lisa Murkowski) voted "present" to allow another to attend his daughter's wedding
- One Democrat (Joe Manchin) voted yes

### Political Impact

The "Kavanaugh Effect":
- Seen as galvanizing Republican voters in 2018 midterms
- Democratic Senators Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly lost their races, blaming how Democrats handled the hearings

## Helsinki Summit with Putin

### Date: July 16, 2018

The Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki, Finland produced one of the most controversial moments of Trump's presidency.

### The Private Meeting

Trump and Putin met privately for two hours - 30 minutes longer than scheduled - with:
- No aides
- No note-takers
- Only a Russian-provided interpreter

No U.S. personnel were present.

### The Press Conference

Asked about Russian election interference, Trump said:

> "My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me, and some others, they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin, he just said it's not Russia. **I will say this, I don't see any reason why it would be.**"

This directly contradicted:
- The U.S. intelligence community's assessment
- His own administration's position
- An indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers announced just 3 days earlier

### Bipartisan Backlash

**Senator John McCain:**
> "One of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory... The damage inflicted by President Trump's naivete, egotism, false equivalence and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate."

**Former CIA Director John Brennan:**
> "Donald Trump's press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of 'high crimes & misdemeanors.' It was nothing short of treasonous."

### The Walk-Back

**July 17, 2018:** Trump claimed he had misspoken due to a "double-negative":

> "I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't'... The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia.'"

Critics noted this explanation didn't address other statements from the press conference.

### Strategic Assessment

Observers called the press conference a diplomatic win for Russia and an embarrassment for the United States.

### Unanswered Questions

No official record exists of what was discussed in the private meeting. Trump reportedly confiscated notes from his interpreter.

## Trade War and Tariffs

### Beginning: January 2018

The U.S.-China trade war began in January 2018 when Trump began imposing tariffs and trade barriers on China.

### 2018 Tariff Timeline

| Date | Action | Scope |
|------|--------|-------|
| March 2018 | Steel/Aluminum tariffs | 25% steel, 10% aluminum |
| July 6, 2018 | Section 301 Tranche 1 | $34 billion in goods (25%) |
| August 23, 2018 | Tranche 2 | $16 billion (25%) |
| September 24, 2018 | Tranche 3 | $200 billion (10%, later 25%) |

- Import tariffs had "neither a sizable nor significant effect on U.S. employment in regions with newly-protected sectors"
- Foreign retaliation "had clear negative employment impacts, particularly in agriculture"

**IMF Paper (January 2024):**
- Estimated reversing 2018-2019 tariffs would increase U.S. output by 4% over three years

### Overall Assessment

Most analyses found:
- Trade deficit widened, not narrowed
- Growth slowed
- Manufacturing jobs did not return as promised
- Prices rose for American consumers

## Michael Cohen Guilty Plea

### Date: August 21, 2018

Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, pleaded guilty to 8 counts and directly implicated Trump in campaign finance violations.

### The Charges

1. Tax evasion (5 counts)
2. Bank fraud (1 count)
3. Campaign finance violations (2 counts)

### The Campaign Finance Violations

Cohen pleaded guilty to facilitating secret payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to prevent them from disclosing affairs with Trump:

| Woman | Payment | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Stormy Daniels | $130,000 | Cohen (reimbursed by Trump Org) |
| Karen McDougal | $150,000 | National Enquirer |

### Why It Was Illegal

The payments were effectively campaign contributions:
- Made to influence the 2016 election
- Corporations cannot contribute directly to campaigns
- Individuals cannot contribute more than $2,700
- The $130,000 and $150,000 payments far exceeded limits

### Implicating Trump

Cohen stated in court that he made the payments **"in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office"** - meaning Trump.

This marked the first time a Trump associate had directly implicated the President in a crime.

### Trump's Shifting Response

- Initially denied knowledge of payments
- Later acknowledged reimbursing Cohen but denied it was a campaign contribution
- Called Cohen a "rat" for cooperating

### Sentencing

**December 12, 2018:** Cohen sentenced to 3 years in prison

The judge noted he was being sentenced in part for "brazen violations of the election laws."

### Long-term Consequences

This case led directly to the New York hush money prosecution of Trump. In 2024, Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts related to falsifying business records to conceal the reimbursement payments.

## Khashoggi Murder Response

### Date: October 2, 2018 (murder)

Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.

### The Victim

Khashoggi was:
- A columnist for The Washington Post
- A Saudi Arabian citizen and U.S. resident
- An outspoken critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS)
- A former Saudi government advisor who fled in 2017

### The Murder

Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage. A 15-person team led by a close MBS associate:
- Drugged him
- Murdered him
- Dismembered him with a bone saw

His remains have never been recovered.

### U.S. Intelligence Finding

A 2021 intelligence community report concluded:

> "We assess that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi... The Crown Prince viewed Khashoggi as a threat to the Kingdom and broadly supported using violent measures if necessary to silence him."

### Trump's Response (2018)

Trump:
- Spent more time praising Saudi Arabia as an ally than reacting to the killing
- Cast doubt on MBS's involvement despite intelligence assessments
- Did not impose significant personal sanctions on MBS

**November 20, 2018:** Trump issued a statement titled "America First!" defending Saudi Arabia:

> "It could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"

### Arms Sales

After the murder set off bipartisan Congressional outrage, Trump:
- Bypassed Congress to sell roughly $8 billion in precision-guided missiles to Saudi Arabia and UAE
- Vetoed 3 Congressional resolutions rebuking him for the sale

### Trump's Later Claims

In Bob Woodward's book, Trump reportedly bragged: "I saved his ass... I was able to get Congress to leave him alone. I was able to get them to stop."

## Emoluments Lawsuits

Multiple lawsuits alleged that Trump's retention of business interests while president violated the Constitution's Emoluments Clauses.

### The Constitutional Provisions

**Foreign Emoluments Clause (Article I, Section 9):**
Bars federal officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments without Congressional consent.

**Domestic Emoluments Clause (Article II, Section 1):**
Bars the President from receiving any emolument from the U.S. or any state beyond his salary.

### Key Lawsuits

#### CREW v. Trump

**Filed:** January 23, 2017 (three days after inauguration)

**Plaintiffs:** Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), hotel and restaurant owners, event bookers

**Allegations:** Trump violated the Foreign Emoluments Clause by accepting payments from foreign governments through his hotels and businesses

**Outcome:** Motion to dismiss granted December 21, 2017; plaintiffs held to lack standing

#### D.C. and Maryland v. Trump

**Filed:** 2017

**Plaintiffs:** Attorneys General of D.C. and Maryland

**Focus:** Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.

**Allegations:**
- Foreign governments paid for officials to stay at Trump's hotel
- State governments did the same
- This violated both Emoluments Clauses

**Notable Rulings:**
- Judge Peter J. Messitte ruled in 2018 that the Constitution forbids the president from receiving anything of value from foreign or domestic governments
- First-ever judicial opinions interpreting the Emoluments Clauses

### The Trump Hotel Issue

The Trump International Hotel, located in the Old Post Office building in Washington D.C., was blocks from the White House. It became a destination for foreign governments seeking to curry favor with the administration.

### Final Outcome

**January 25, 2021:** The Supreme Court dismissed the emoluments cases as moot because Trump had left office.

The constitutional questions were never definitively resolved.

## Context: The Access Hollywood Tape

While this predates Trump's presidency, it provides important context.

### Date: October 7, 2016 (released)

The Washington Post published a 2005 video of Trump and Billy Bush in which Trump described his approach to women:

> "I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything... Grab 'em by the pussy."

### Immediate Reaction

- Many Republicans called on Trump to drop out
- Multiple Republicans (including Sen. Mike Lee) called on him to step down
- Billy Bush was fired from the Today show

### Trump's Response

Called it "locker room banter" and issued an apology video.

### Electoral Impact

A 2020 study found the tape modestly but significantly reduced support for Trump, with larger effects among Republicans than Democrats.

Despite this, Trump won the 2016 election, which was viewed as defying political gravity.

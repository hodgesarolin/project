# US Foreign Interventions, Coups, and Support for Dictators
## A Comprehensive Historical Record (1898-Present)

*"I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism."*

## 1. Early American Empire (1898-1934)

### The Spanish-American War (1898)

The Spanish-American War marked the United States' emergence as an imperial power. Following the mysterious explosion of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor (later investigations suggest an internal accident, not Spanish sabotage), the US declared war on Spain.

**Territories Acquired:**
- **Philippines** - Purchased from Spain for $20 million
- **Puerto Rico** - Ceded by Spain, remains a US territory today
- **Guam** - Ceded by Spain, now a US military installation
- **Cuba** - Nominally independent but under US control via the Platt Amendment

**The Platt Amendment (1901):**
Forced into Cuba's constitution, this gave the US:
- The right to intervene in Cuban affairs
- Control of Guantanamo Bay (still held today)
- Veto power over Cuban treaties and debts

*Source: Treaty of Paris (1898); Platt Amendment text, Congressional Record*

---

### The Philippine-American War (1899-1902, resistance continued until 1913)

Often called "America's First Vietnam," this brutal counterinsurgency war is largely omitted from US history education.

**Background:**
Filipino revolutionaries, led by Emilio Aguinaldo, had been fighting for independence from Spain. They believed the US would support their independence. Instead, the US purchased the Philippines and fought to suppress the independence movement.

**Death Toll:**
- **Filipino civilians:** 200,000 to 1,000,000 dead
- Most deaths from famine and disease caused by US military tactics
- **US soldiers:** approximately 4,200 dead

**Documented Atrocities:**

**Torture - The "Water Cure":**
US soldiers waterboarded Filipino prisoners. Army veteran A.F. Miller testified to Congress:
> "Lay them on their backs, a man standing on each hand and each foot, then put a round stick in the mouth and pour a pail of water in the mouth and nose, and if they don't give up, pour in another pail. They swell up like toads."

*Source: Senate Document 331, 57th Congress (1902)*

**Concentration Camps:**
General J. Franklin Bell ordered civilians into "zones of protection" (concentration camps) in Batangas province. Those outside were considered enemies. Entire provinces were depopulated.

**Kill Orders:**
General Jacob H. Smith ordered his troops to kill everyone over age 10 on the island of Samar:
> "I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn, the more you kill and burn the better it will please me. The interior of Samar must be made into a howling wilderness."

*Source: Court-martial records of General Smith (1902)*

**Racial Ideology:**
The war was explicitly framed in racial terms. President McKinley spoke of the need to "uplift and Christianize" Filipinos (who were already largely Christian). Newspapers referred to Filipinos as "niggers" and compared the war to Indian extermination.

*Sources: Lodge Committee Hearings (1902); Stuart Creighton Miller, "Benevolent Assimilation" (1982)*

### The Banana Wars (1898-1934)

A series of occupations, police actions, and interventions in Central America and the Caribbean, primarily serving US corporate interests.

**Honduras:**
- **1903:** US Marines land to "protect American interests"
- **1907:** Marines land during war with Nicaragua
- **1911:** Marines land to protect American banana interests
- **1912:** Marines land to prevent government seizure of US railroad
- **1919:** Marines land during election dispute
- **1924-1925:** Marines land to protect United Fruit Company

**Nicaragua (1912-1933):**
- US Marines occupied Nicaragua almost continuously for 21 years
- Installed and maintained the Somoza family dynasty
- Created and trained the Guardia Nacional (National Guard) that would terrorize Nicaraguans for decades
- Fought guerrilla war against Augusto Sandino (killed 1934)

**Haiti (1915-1934):**
- **19-year occupation** following Marine invasion
- Imposed new constitution (written by Franklin D. Roosevelt) allowing foreign land ownership
- Reinstated forced labor (corvée system)
- Killed an estimated 15,000 Haitians during "Cacos" rebellion suppression
- Installed client governments and controlled customs revenues
- Marines committed documented massacres and summary executions

*Source: Senate Inquiry into Occupation of Haiti and Santo Domingo (1922)*

**Dominican Republic (1916-1924):**
- Full military occupation for 8 years
- Disarmed the population
- Created and trained the Guardia Nacional (later used by Trujillo dictatorship)
- Controlled all government functions

**Mexico:**
- **1914:** Occupation of Veracruz (over 200 Mexicans killed)
- **1916-1917:** "Punitive Expedition" into Mexico (10,000 troops)

---

### Corporate Interests: The United Fruit Company

The United Fruit Company (now Chiquita Brands) exemplified the merger of corporate and government power:

**Business Model:**
- Controlled vast plantations across Central America
- Owned railroads, ports, telegraph lines
- Paid minimal taxes through sweetheart deals with compliant governments
- Workers lived in company towns, paid in company scrip

**Political Power:**
- Company executives moved between corporate boards and government positions
- Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and CIA Director Allen Dulles were both shareholders and former legal counsel for United Fruit
- The company's PR man, Edward Bernays, pioneered propaganda techniques to influence US policy

**"Banana Republics":**
The term was coined to describe countries whose governments existed to serve US fruit company interests. When governments attempted land reform or labor rights, the US military intervened.

### Smedley Butler's Confession

Major General Smedley Darlington Butler was the most decorated Marine in US history at the time of his death. His 1935 book "War is a Racket" exposed the true purpose of his military service:

> "I spent most of my time being a high-class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras 'right' for American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested."

**The Business Plot (1933):**
Butler also testified to Congress that Wall Street businessmen approached him to lead a fascist coup against President Franklin Roosevelt. The "Business Plot" was investigated and confirmed by the McCormack-Dickstein Committee, though no prosecutions followed.

## 2. CIA Coups During the Cold War

### Iran (1953) - Operation AJAX/TPAJAX

**Background:**
Iran had been exploited by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later BP). Iranians received only 16% of oil profits. In 1951, the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh nationalized the oil industry with broad popular support.

**The Coup:**
- Britain (MI6) and US (CIA) organized "Operation Ajax"
- CIA officer Kermit Roosevelt Jr. directed operations from Tehran
- Paid mobs, bribed military officers, planted propaganda
- Mossadegh was overthrown on August 19, 1953

**The Result:**
- Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi restored to absolute power
- Created SAVAK secret police (trained by CIA and Mossad)
- SAVAK tortured and killed thousands of dissidents
- Oil returned to Western control (US companies got 40% stake)
- Shah ruled as dictator until 1979 Islamic Revolution

**The Blowback:**
The 1979 Iranian Revolution and hostage crisis were direct consequences. Iranians had not forgotten 1953. The US is still dealing with the aftermath.

**Declassification:**
The CIA officially acknowledged the coup in 2013, releasing internal documents.

## 3. Operation Condor

### Overview

Operation Condor was a US-coordinated campaign of political repression and assassination involving the intelligence services of six South American dictatorships:

- **Chile** (Pinochet)
- **Argentina** (military junta)
- **Brazil** (military regime)
- **Paraguay** (Stroessner)
- **Uruguay** (military regime)
- **Bolivia** (Banzer and successors)

**Period:** 1968-1989 (peak activity 1975-1983)

### Scale of the Horror

- **60,000+ killed**
- **400,000+ imprisoned**
- **30,000 "disappeared"** (Argentina alone)
- Victims included students, labor leaders, journalists, priests, nuns

### Methods

**Disappearances:**
Victims were abducted, tortured for information, then killed. Bodies were often disposed of so families would never know their fate. In Argentina, drugged prisoners were thrown alive from planes over the Atlantic Ocean ("death flights").

**Torture:**
- Electric shock (the "picana")
- Waterboarding
- Rape (systematic, including with animals and objects)
- Burning
- Prolonged hanging
- Sensory deprivation

**Stealing of Children:**
In Argentina, pregnant prisoners were kept alive until they gave birth. Their babies were then given to military families. Approximately 500 children were stolen this way. The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo continue searching for them today.

### Henry Kissinger's Role

As National Security Advisor and Secretary of State, Kissinger:
- Met with Pinochet and expressed support
- Gave Argentina's junta "green light" for dirty war
- Delayed State Department warnings about human rights that might have saved lives
- Told Argentine Foreign Minister: "If there are things that have to be done, you should do them quickly"

**Declassified cable (1976):**
> "We want you to succeed... The quicker you succeed the better."
— Kissinger to Argentine junta representatives

### US Training and Support

**Personnel:**
Many Condor operatives trained at:
- School of the Americas (Fort Benning, Georgia)
- CIA facilities
- FBI offices

**Technology:**
The US provided:
- Communications equipment
- Telex machines connecting intelligence services
- Computer systems for tracking victims
- Training in interrogation techniques

**Assassination on US Soil:**
Operation Condor assassinated Chilean exile Orlando Letelier with a car bomb in Washington D.C. (1976). The FBI knew of the threat beforehand but did not prevent it.

## 5. Vietnam War: The Complete Picture

### The Gulf of Tonkin Incident (1964) - The Lie That Started a War

**What Americans Were Told:**
On August 4, 1964, President Johnson announced that North Vietnamese torpedo boats had attacked USS Maddox and USS Turner Joy in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin. This "unprovoked aggression" was used to pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, giving Johnson authority to escalate military involvement.

**What Actually Happened:**
- The August 2 attack was real, but occurred while Maddox was supporting South Vietnamese commando raids on North Vietnam
- The August 4 attack **never happened**
- Maddox crew fired at radar shadows and sonar ghosts
- NSA intercepts were misrepresented to suggest attack
- Defense Secretary McNamara knew the truth but lied to Congress

**Declassified NSA Study (2005):**
> "It is not simply that there is a different story as to what happened; it is that no attack happened that night."

**The Result:**
Based on this fabrication, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution 98-2 in the Senate and 416-0 in the House. This authorized the full-scale war that would kill millions.

### Death Toll

**Vietnamese Deaths:**
- **2,000,000 to 3,000,000 Vietnamese killed**
- Majority were civilians
- North and South Vietnamese combined

**Other Deaths:**
- Cambodians: 500,000-600,000
- Laotians: 200,000+
- Americans: 58,220

**Wounded and Affected:**
- Millions maimed
- Millions of refugees
- Ongoing deaths from unexploded ordnance

---

### Agent Orange

**What It Was:**
A chemical defoliant containing dioxin, one of the most toxic substances known.

**Scale of Use:**
- 20 million gallons sprayed over South Vietnam
- 10% of South Vietnam sprayed at least once
- Crops, forests, villages targeted

**Effects:**
- 4.8 million Vietnamese exposed
- Birth defects continue to this day
- Cancers, immune disorders, neurological damage
- 150,000+ children born with defects attributed to Agent Orange
- US veterans also suffered (VA eventually acknowledged)

**Corporate Profit:**
Monsanto, Dow Chemical, and others produced Agent Orange. They knew of dioxin contamination. Internal documents show awareness of health risks.

*Source: Stellman, "The Extent and Patterns of Usage of Agent Orange" (2003); VA records*

### The My Lai Massacre (March 16, 1968)

**What Happened:**
US soldiers from Charlie Company entered the village of My Lai. Over four hours, they systematically murdered between 347 and 504 unarmed civilians—old men, women, children, babies. Many women were gang-raped before being killed.

**Perpetrators' Actions:**
- Shot people in ditches
- Bayoneted babies
- Raped and mutilated women
- Burned the village
- Killed all livestock

**The Cover-Up:**
- Army initially reported "128 Viet Cong killed"
- Soldiers were ordered to say nothing
- Investigation only occurred after soldier Ron Ridenhour wrote letters
- Army covered up for over a year

**Justice:**
- Of 26 soldiers charged, only Lt. William Calley was convicted
- Calley served 3.5 years of house arrest
- Many Americans viewed him as scapegoat, not criminal
- Nixon reduced his sentence

**Other Massacres:**
My Lai was not unique. Declassified documents reveal numerous similar incidents:
- My Khe (same day as My Lai)
- "Mere Gook Rule" (treating Vietnamese lives as worthless)
- "Free fire zones" where anyone could be killed
- "Body count" metrics incentivizing civilian deaths

*Sources: Peers Commission Report; Seymour Hersh, "My Lai 4" (1970); Vietnam War Crimes Working Group files*

- CIA-trained interrogators
- Assassination teams
- Civilian targets based on often-unreliable intelligence

**Documented Abuses:**
- Torture was routine
- Electric shock, water torture, beatings
- "Bell telephone" (electric wires to genitals)
- Many victims were innocent civilians fingered by informants with personal grudges

### The Bombing of Cambodia (1969-1973)

**The Secret War:**
Nixon and Kissinger secretly (and illegally) expanded the war to Cambodia without Congressional approval or public knowledge.

**Scale:**
- 2.7 million tons of bombs dropped
- More than all bombs dropped in WWII combined
- 100,000-600,000 Cambodian civilians killed (estimates vary)

**Methods:**
- B-52 "carpet bombing"
- "Menu" operations (code names: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, etc.)
- Falsified records to hide bombing from Congress

**Consequences:**
- Destabilized Cambodia
- Pushed peasants toward Khmer Rouge
- Enabled Pol Pot's rise to power
- Khmer Rouge genocide (1975-79) killed 1.7-2.5 million

**Kissinger's Role:**
Kissinger personally oversaw target selection. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973.

### Laos: The Most Bombed Country in History

**The Secret War:**
From 1964-1973, the US dropped 2.5 million tons of bombs on Laos—a neutral country. This was kept secret from the American public and Congress.

**Scale:**
- More bombs than dropped on Germany and Japan combined in WWII
- On average, a planeload of bombs every 8 minutes, 24 hours a day, for 9 years
- 580,000 bombing missions

**Casualties:**
- 200,000+ killed during the bombing
- 50,000+ killed since by unexploded ordnance (UXO)

- 100 people still killed or maimed annually by UXO

**Why:**
To disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail and support the "Secret Army" of Hmong fighters recruited by the CIA.

A tiny elite (the "Fourteen Families") controlled most land and wealth. Peasants, labor unions, and the Catholic Church organized for reform. The military responded with death squads.

**US Role:**
- $6 billion in aid over 12 years
- Trained Salvadoran military at School of the Americas
- Provided weapons, helicopters, intelligence
- Reagan administration certified "human rights progress" to continue aid despite evidence of massacres

**Death Toll:**
- **75,000 killed** (UN Truth Commission estimate)
- 85% of atrocities committed by military and death squads
- Vast majority of victims were civilians

**Key Atrocities:**

**Archbishop Oscar Romero (March 24, 1980):**
While saying Mass, Romero was shot by death squad sniper. He had called on soldiers to disobey orders to kill. US-trained soldiers were implicated.

**The El Mozote Massacre (December 1981):**
Atlacatl Battalion (US-trained) killed over 900 civilians in and around El Mozote:
- Men were tortured and executed
- Women were raped before being killed
- Children were killed last, some burned alive in a building
- Youngest victim was 2 days old

The Reagan administration denied the massacre. The New York Times and Washington Post initially minimized it. The truth was confirmed in 1992 by UN forensic teams.

**The Jesuit Murders (November 1989):**
Atlacatl Battalion members murdered six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her daughter. 19 of 26 officers responsible were School of the Americas graduates.

### Guatemala: Genocide of the Maya (1960-1996)

**Background:**
Following the 1954 CIA coup, Guatemala suffered continuous military rule and civil war. The military targeted labor leaders, students, professionals, and increasingly, indigenous Maya communities.

**Death Toll:**
- **200,000 killed**
- 83% of identified victims were Maya
- 93% of atrocities attributed to state forces (UN)

**Key Period: 1981-1983 (Ríos Montt)**
- 626 massacres documented
- Entire villages destroyed
- Scorched earth campaign
- Women raped before being killed
- Children killed by smashing heads against rocks
- Pregnant women had fetuses cut from their bodies

**US Role:**
- Military aid continued (sometimes covertly when Congress banned it)
- CIA on the ground
- School of the Americas trained many perpetrators
- Reagan called Ríos Montt "totally dedicated to democracy"

**UN Findings (1999):**
The UN Historical Clarification Commission concluded that the state committed "acts of genocide" against the Maya. The US was found to have provided support.

**Justice:**
Ríos Montt was convicted of genocide in 2013 (later overturned on procedural grounds). He died before final resolution.

### Nicaragua: The Contra War (1981-1990)

**Background:**
The Sandinista revolution overthrew the US-backed Somoza dictatorship in 1979. The Reagan administration determined to destroy the Sandinistas.

**The Contras:**
- Formed from Somoza's National Guard remnants
- Recruited, trained, and funded by CIA
- Based in Honduras
- Waged guerrilla war against Nicaragua

**Contra Atrocities (documented by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International):**
- Targeted health clinics, schools, agricultural cooperatives
- Killed civilians, including children
- Rape as weapon
- Torture and mutilation

**CIA Manual:**
The CIA produced "Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare," a manual for the Contras that included instructions on assassination ("neutralization") and creating martyrs.

**The Iran-Contra Scandal:**
When Congress cut off Contra funding (Boland Amendment), the Reagan administration illegally:
- Sold weapons to Iran (under arms embargo)
- Used profits to fund Contras
- Oliver North ran operations from White House basement

**Key Players:**
- Oliver North: Convicted (overturned on technicality), later Fox News host, NRA president
- John Poindexter: National Security Advisor, convicted (overturned), later served under Bush II
- Elliott Abrams: Pled guilty, pardoned, later served under Bush II and Trump
- Reagan claimed not to know

**Death Toll:**
- 30,000+ Nicaraguans killed
- Economy devastated
- US later found guilty of violations by International Court of Justice (US refused to recognize the ruling)

## 7. Middle East Interventions

### Iran 1953 and Its Blowback

**1953:**
CIA/MI6 coup overthrew democratic government, installed Shah (see Section 2).

**1953-1979:**
Shah ruled with US support. SAVAK terrorized population. Iranians never forgot.

**1979:**
Islamic Revolution. Students took US Embassy hostages (444 days). From the Iranian perspective, this was payback for 1953.

**The Lesson:**
US intervention in 1953 led directly to the hostile Iranian government today. Decades of "blowback."

---

### US Support for Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988)

**The War:**
Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in 1980. The US supported Iraq despite:
- Iraq being the aggressor
- Iraq using chemical weapons
- Iraq being a dictatorship

**US Support:**
- Removed Iraq from terrorism list (1982)
- Provided intelligence on Iranian positions
- Provided agricultural credits diverted to weapons
- Blocked UN resolutions condemning Iraq
- Donald Rumsfeld visited Baghdad (1983-84) as Reagan envoy

**Chemical Weapons:**
Iraq used chemical weapons (mustard gas, nerve agents) against Iranians and Iraqi Kurds. The US continued support. When Iraq gassed the Kurdish town of Halabja (1988), killing 5,000, the Reagan administration initially tried to blame Iran.

**The Cynicism:**
The US also covertly supplied some weapons to Iran (Iran-Contra), seeming to want both sides to bleed.

*Sources: National Security Archive Iraq documentation; Congressional reports*

---

### Gulf War (1991)

**The Highway of Death:**
As Iraqi forces retreated from Kuwait on Highway 80, US forces bombed the convoy for hours, killing thousands of retreating soldiers and civilians. The images were suppressed from US media but circulated internationally.

**Sanctions on Iraq (1990-2003):**
UN sanctions (pushed by US and UK) devastated Iraqi civilian life:
- Healthcare system collapsed
- Water treatment impossible
- Child mortality skyrocketed
- UNICEF estimated 500,000 excess child deaths

**"Worth It":**
In a 1996 60 Minutes interview, Lesley Stahl asked Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: "We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?"

Albright: "I think this is a very hard choice, but the price—we think the price is worth it."

*Sources: UNICEF Iraq surveys; 60 Minutes transcript*

---

### Iraq War (2003-2011)

**The Lies:**
The Bush administration justified invasion based on:
- **WMD that didn't exist** (later acknowledged)
- **Iraq-Al Qaeda connection that didn't exist** (9/11 Commission finding)
- **Niger uranium that was fabricated** ("16 words" in State of Union)

**Key Lies and Liars:**
- Colin Powell's UN presentation (February 2003): Every claim proven false
- Cheney's "we know where the WMD are": We didn't
- Rumsfeld's "we know where they are": We didn't
- "Curveball" source was known to be unreliable

**Death Toll:**
- **200,000 to 1,000,000+ Iraqi deaths** (various studies)
- Lancet study (2006): 654,965 excess deaths
- Iraq Body Count (documented): 200,000+
- US soldiers: 4,400+

**Torture at Abu Ghraib:**
In 2004, photos emerged of US soldiers torturing Iraqi prisoners:
- Sexual humiliation
- Forced nudity
- Electric shock threats
- Dog attacks
- Stress positions
- Murder (at least two prisoners)

The torture was not "rogue" soldiers. "Enhanced interrogation" was official policy approved at the highest levels.

**The Torture Memos:**
Justice Department lawyers (John Yoo, Jay Bybee) wrote legal opinions justifying torture. Methods used:
- Waterboarding
- Sleep deprivation (up to 180 hours)
- Walling (slamming into walls)
- Stress positions
- Cramped confinement

### Drone Warfare

**Expansion Under Obama:**
While drone strikes began under Bush, Obama massively expanded their use:
- 10x more strikes in Pakistan than Bush
- Expanded to Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Syria
- ~563 strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia (Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimate)

**Civilian Deaths:**
- Official US counts dramatically undercount civilian deaths
- Independent estimates: 800-1,100 civilians killed in Pakistan alone
- "Double tap" strikes hit rescuers
- "Signature strikes" targeted military-age males without identification

**"Kill List" and "Terror Tuesdays":**
Obama personally approved kill list of targets. Meetings every Tuesday decided who would die.

**Due Process:**
US citizens were killed without trial:
- Anwar al-Awlaki (September 2011)
- His 16-year-old son Abdulrahman (October 2011, apparently accidental)
- Nawar al-Awlaki, 8 years old (January 2017, Trump administration)

**The Precedent:**
Established precedent of extra-judicial assassination worldwide, including of US citizens.

## 8. Pattern Recognition and Analysis

### "Democracy Promotion" vs. Actual Goals

**The Rhetoric:**
Every intervention has been justified by appeals to democracy, freedom, human rights, and civilization.

**The Reality:**
The US has repeatedly:
- Overthrown democratically elected governments (Iran, Guatemala, Chile, etc.)
- Installed dictators
- Supported dictators against democratic movements
- Armed and trained death squads
- Blocked land reform that threatened US corporate interests

**The Pattern:**
When governments pursue policies contrary to US interests—even through democratic means—they become targets. When dictators serve US interests, they receive support regardless of atrocities.

**Quote:**
> "The United States is not nearly so concerned that its satellites be democratic as that they remain in the American sphere of influence."
— George Kennan, State Department Policy Planning Staff Director (1948)

---

### Corporate Interests Driving Intervention

**United Fruit Company (Guatemala, Honduras, etc.):**
When Árbenz threatened unused UFC land, the Dulles brothers (both with UFC ties) orchestrated a coup.

**Oil Companies (Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia):**
- 1953 Iran coup restored Western oil access
- US protects Saudi Arabia despite human rights record
- Iraq invasion followed Saddam's threat to sell oil in euros

**Mining Companies (Chile, Congo, etc.):**
- Anaconda and Kennecott copper companies opposed Allende
- Katanga province mining interests shaped Congo policy

**General Pattern:**
Smedley Butler was right: military intervention has consistently served corporate interests, whatever the stated justification.

---

### Blowback and Unintended Consequences

**Definition:**
CIA term for unintended consequences of covert operations.

**Examples:**
- **1953 Iran coup → 1979 revolution → ongoing hostility**
- **Support for Afghan mujahideen → Al Qaeda → 9/11**
- **Iraq war → ISIS**
- **Supporting Saddam → Gulf Wars**
- **Cambodia bombing → Khmer Rouge**
- **Central America interventions → refugee crises**

**The Cycle:**
1. Intervene to solve perceived problem
2. Create conditions for new problems
3. Intervene again to solve those problems
4. Create more problems
5. Repeat

---

### Declassified Documents vs. Public Statements

**What They Said Then:**
- "We seek no territory" (McKinley on Philippines)
- "We must defend democracy" (Cold War)
- "We don't torture" (Bush administration)
- "Saddam has WMD" (Iraq War)

**What Documents Show:**
- Philippines was colonial acquisition
- We overthrew democracies and installed dictators
- We tortured systematically
- WMD claims were fabricated or exaggerated

**The Importance of Declassification:**
Most of what we know comes from:
- Freedom of Information Act requests
- Congressional investigations (Church Committee, Iran-Contra)
- Whistleblowers (Pentagon Papers, torture photos)
- Time passing (automatic declassification after 25+ years)

**What Remains Classified:**
Much remains hidden. What we know may be the tip of the iceberg.

## Conclusion

This document covers only a portion of US foreign interventions. Not included are:
- Full details of African interventions
- Asian interventions beyond those mentioned
- Ongoing support for repressive regimes
- Economic warfare and sanctions regimes
- Covert operations that remain classified

The pattern is consistent across a century:
1. Intervention is justified by idealistic rhetoric
2. Actual motivations are strategic and economic
3. Local populations bear the costs
4. Consequences ("blowback") generate new crises
5. History is sanitized for domestic consumption
6. The truth emerges decades later through declassification

Understanding this history is essential for understanding:
- Why much of the world views the US with suspicion
- Why "anti-American" sentiment exists
- Why some regions remain unstable
- Why refugees flee toward the country that destabilized their homelands
- Why the gap between American ideals and American actions matters

As Smedley Butler concluded: "War is a racket."

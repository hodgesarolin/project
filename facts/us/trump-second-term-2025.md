## January 6 Pardons

### Scope of Pardons
On January 20, 2025, Trump issued sweeping clemency to **over 1,500 people** charged in connection with the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack, ending the largest criminal prosecution in American history.

> [!warning] Violence Statistics
> The January 6 attack **injured more than 140 police officers** - one of the largest mass attacks on law enforcement in U.S. history. More than **600 rioters** had been convicted of assault on officers, and **170** had used deadly weapons.

### Categories of Clemency
1. **Full Pardons:** The vast majority received "full, complete and unconditional pardons"
2. **Commutations:** 14 individuals received sentence commutations to time served

### Notable Figures Who Received Clemency

#### Oath Keepers
| Name | Original Sentence | Clemency Type |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| Stewart Rhodes (Leader) | 18 years | Commutation |

According to inside sources, Trump made the decision for blanket pardons at the "last minute" just days before inauguration. One advisor reported Trump said: **"F*** it: Release 'em all."**

In his December 8, 2024 interview on Meet the Press, Trump had said he would pardon rioters except for any "radical, crazy" ones - this distinction was abandoned.

- Rudy Giuliani
- Sidney Powell
- John Eastman
- Jenna Ellis

### Post-Pardon Criminal Activity
Multiple pardoned January 6 rioters have subsequently faced **new criminal charges** for other offenses since their release.

## Democracy Assessments

### Expert and Academic Evaluations

#### Bright Line Watch Survey (500+ Political Scientists)
| Period | Democracy Score (0-100) |
|--------|------------------------|
| Post-2024 Election | 67 |
| Early Second Term | **55** |

> [!warning] Expert Consensus
> "The vast majority think the United States is moving swiftly from liberal democracy toward some form of authoritarianism."

#### Steven Levitsky (Harvard, co-author "How Democracies Die")
> "We've slid into some form of authoritarianism... It is relatively mild compared to some others. It is certainly reversible, but **we are no longer living in a liberal democracy**."

**Comparison:** Turkey under Erdogan, El Salvador, Hungary today

**Most Likely Outcome:** "Competitive authoritarianism" - constitutional democracies with elections and legal opposition, but systematic abuse of power tilts playing field.

### International Assessments

#### CIVICUS Report
- Downgraded U.S. civic freedoms from **"narrowed" to "obstructed"**
- Found "rapid authoritarian shift"
- "Press freedom is under pressure, with censorship, judicial harassment and political interference"

#### Reporters Without Borders
- U.S. ranked **57th of 180 countries** - lowest ever for domestic conditions

### Security Expert Warnings

**October 16, 2025 Report:** "Accelerating Authoritarian Dynamics: Assessment of Democratic Decline"

**Authors:** Network of 300+ national and homeland security experts including:
- Former FBI Directors
- CIA executives
- Ambassadors

**Finding:** Trump administration initiatives to expand executive power show signs of rapid democratic backsliding.

### Project 2025 Implementation

|--------|-------------------|
| Crowd-sourced trackers | ~50% |
| Center for Progressive Reform (Sept 2025) | **47%** |

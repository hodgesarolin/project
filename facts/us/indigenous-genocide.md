## 1. Scale of Loss

### Pre-Contact Population Estimates

The scholarly debate over pre-Columbian population of North America has evolved significantly over the past century:

**Conservative Early Estimates:**
- **James Mooney (1910):** Approximately 1,115,000 individuals north of the Rio Grande at contact
- **A.L. Kroeber (1934):** Revised to approximately 900,000 for the same region

**Higher Modern Estimates:**
- **Henry Dobyns (1966):** Between 9.8 million and 12.2 million north of the Rio Grande
- **Henry Dobyns (1983 revision):** Up to 18 million people
- **Current scholarly consensus:** Most estimates for North America (modern U.S. and Canada) range from 2.5 million to 7 million, with some studies estimating up to 18 million

For the entire Western Hemisphere, newer estimates fall between 45 and 60 million people, with a 2018 study estimating over 60 million based on carbon records.

### The Population Nadir

By 1900, the Indigenous population in the United States reached its lowest point:

- **1900 Census:** 237,196 Indigenous people - the demographic nadir
- This represents a population loss of **95-99%** from pre-contact estimates
- The National Archives confirms this was the first census to enumerate all Native Americans regardless of tribal affiliation

### The Scholarly Debate: Was It Genocide?

**The UN Genocide Convention Definition (1948):**
Article II defines genocide as acts "committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group as such."

**Arguments That It Meets the Definition:**

- Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term "genocide," explicitly cited the displacement of Native Americans by European settlers as a historical example
- Historian Benjamin Madley has documented state-sponsored killing campaigns that meet the legal definition
- Multiple specific events (California, Sand Creek, etc.) show explicit intent to exterminate

**The Scholarly Divide:**

- Indigenous and genocide studies scholars increasingly accept the genocide framework
- Mainstream U.S. and Native American history scholarship has often preferred terms like "ethnic cleansing" or describing certain events as "genocidal"
- The UN Convention's emphasis on "intent" creates debates, as some argue the overall destruction resulted from multiple factors including disease

**Cultural Genocide:**

The original UN Convention draft included cultural genocide, but colonial powers (Belgium, Denmark, France, Netherlands, UK) and settler nations (U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand) opposed its inclusion. This exclusion has significant implications for characterizing boarding school policies and cultural destruction.

## 2. Colonial Era Violence (1607-1776)

### The Anglo-Powhatan Wars (1610-1646)

**First Anglo-Powhatan War (1609-1614):**
- Powhatan laid siege to Jamestown in winter 1609-1610
- Of 500 colonists, only 60 survived the "starving time"
- Colonists resorted to cannibalism; archaeological evidence confirms this
- Peace established through the marriage of Pocahontas to John Rolfe (1614)

**Second Anglo-Powhatan War (1622-1632):**
- March 22, 1622: Coordinated Powhatan attacks killed 347 colonists (one-quarter of the Virginia population)
- English retaliation targeted Indigenous food stores and supplies
- Peace treaty signed in 1632

**Third Anglo-Powhatan War (1644-1646):**
- Opechancanough, now in his 90s, led attacks killing 400 colonists
- War resulted in the destruction of the Powhatan Confederacy's power
- Opechancanough captured and murdered while a prisoner

### The Pequot War (1636-1638) - The First Major Massacre

**The Mystic Massacre (May 26, 1637):**

Captain John Mason led 90 colonists and 100 Mohegan warriors against the Pequot village at Mystic, Connecticut. The attack occurred at dawn while most warriors were away:

- Mason ordered the village set ablaze with two exits blocked
- **Death toll:** 400-700 Pequot killed, including women, children, and elderly
- English casualties: 2 confirmed dead, 22-26 wounded
- Survivors were sold into slavery in Bermuda or the West Indies

**Treaty of Hartford (1638):**
- Sought to eradicate Pequot cultural identity
- Prohibited Pequots from returning to their lands
- Banned speaking their tribal language
- Prohibited referring to themselves as Pequots

The Mystic Massacre demonstrated English willingness to wage total war against Indigenous peoples.

### King Philip's War (1675-1678) - Deadliest Per Capita War

**Key Facts:**
- Led by Metacom (King Philip), sachem of the Wampanoag
- **Remains the highest loss of life per capita of any war in colonial or U.S. history**

**Casualties:**
- At least 5% of colonists killed
- Over 5,000 Indigenous people killed
- At least 1,000 Indigenous people sold into slavery
- 1,200 colonial homes burned
- Half of all settlements attacked; 12 completely destroyed
- Nearly one-tenth of men available for military service lost

**Outcome:**
- Wampanoags and Narragansett allies nearly completely destroyed
- Metacom killed August 12, 1676; his head displayed on a pike in Plymouth for 20 years
- His son and wife sold into slavery in the Caribbean

### Colonial Scalp Bounties

Colonial governments institutionalized the payment of bounties for Indigenous scalps:

**Massachusetts:**
- Issued over 60 scalp bounties from the 1680s through the 1750s
- **Spencer Phips Proclamation (1755):**
  - Male scalp: 50 pounds (a year's salary for clergy)
  - Female scalp: 35 pounds
  - Child under 12: 25 pounds (20 pounds in some accounts)

**Pennsylvania:**
- **Scalp Act of 1756:** Lieutenant Governor Robert Morris declared war on the Lenni-Lenape (Delaware)
  - Male scalp over age 12: 130 pieces of eight
  - Female scalp: 50 pieces of eight
- The Paxton Boys killed and scalped 20 Indigenous people in 1763

**Historian Benjamin Madley's Research:**
"Policymakers offered bounties for Native American heads or scalps in at least twenty-three states or their colonial, territorial, or Mexican antecedents."

## 3. Early Republic (1776-1830)

### The Northwest Indian War (1785-1795)

Also known as Little Turtle's War, this was the U.S. Army's first of the Indian Wars.

**Background:**
- Despite the Treaty of Paris (1783), Britain maintained forts and supported Indigenous nations
- The Western Confederacy united multiple tribes against American expansion
- Leaders: Miami chief Little Turtle and Shawnee chief Blue Jacket

**Battle of Tippecanoe (November 7, 1811):**
- While Tecumseh was away recruiting, William Henry Harrison attacked
- Prophetstown burned to the ground
- The confederacy weakened but not destroyed

**War of 1812 and Tecumseh's Death:**
- Tecumseh allied with the British
- Helped capture Detroit in August 1812

---

## 4. Indian Removal Era (1830-1850)

### The Indian Removal Act (1830)

Signed into law by President Andrew Jackson, this act authorized:
- Negotiation of treaties for exchange of Indigenous lands for territory west of the Mississippi
- Payment of annuities
- Forcible removal of Southeastern tribes to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma)

During Jackson's presidency:
- Nearly **70 removal treaties** signed
- Almost **50,000 Indigenous people** forced to Indian Territory
- Millions of acres opened to white settlement

### The Trail of Tears (1836-1839)

**Affected Nations:** Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek), Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw - known as the "Five Civilized Tribes"

**Cherokee Removal (1838):**
- Following the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia (1828)
- May 23, 1838 deadline for voluntary removal passed
- Remaining Cherokee rounded up into camps
- Approximately **16,000 Cherokee** forced to march nearly 1,200 miles

### Worcester v. Georgia (1832) - Jackson's Defiance

**The Case:**
- Georgia law (1831) forbade whites from residing on Cherokee lands without state license
- Missionaries Samuel Worcester and Elizur Butler arrested and sentenced to four years hard labor

**Supreme Court Ruling (March 3, 1832):**
- 5-1 decision that all Georgia laws regarding the Cherokee were unconstitutional
- Chief Justice Marshall: Indian nations were "distinct, independent political communities retaining their original natural rights"

**Jackson's Response:**
- Reportedly said: "John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it"
- Declined to enforce the Supreme Court's ruling
- Georgia ignored the decision and kept missionaries imprisoned

**Result:**
- Cherokee removal proceeded despite Supreme Court ruling
- The Trail of Tears followed six years later

## 5. California Genocide (1846-1873)

### State-Sponsored Extermination

Following the Mexican-American War and the California Gold Rush (1849), the state of California engaged in systematic destruction of Indigenous peoples.

**Governor Peter Burnett's 1851 State of the State Address:**
> "That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected. While we cannot anticipate this result but with painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power or wisdom of man to avert."

### Population Collapse

- **Pre-contact population:** Approximately 150,000
- **By 1870:** Approximately 30,000
- **Loss: 80% of the population in approximately 25 years**

### The Act for the Government and Protection of Indians (1850)

Despite its name, this "Indian Indenture Act":
- Legalized the forced labor of Indigenous people
- Allowed whites to obtain custody of Indigenous children
- Permitted local authorities to hire out Indigenous people convicted of vagrancy
- Enabled what historian Benjamin Madley calls a "killing machine"

### State Financial Support for Violence

- Governor Burnett's administration reimbursed Indian-killing militias hundreds of thousands of dollars
- By January 1854, California had spent **$924,259** on what historian Lindsay terms "Native American genocide"
- State militias received financial support for killing campaigns

### Major Massacres

**Bloody Island Massacre (May 15, 1850):**
- U.S. Cavalry under Lt. Nathaniel Lyon attacked Pomo people at Clear Lake
- Orders were to "proceed against the Clear Lake Indians, and exterminate if possible the tribe"
- **Death toll:** Estimates range from 60 to 800 Pomo killed
- Victims were primarily old men, women, and children
- 75 more Pomo killed along the Russian River

**Bounties:**
- Red Bluff, Marysville, and other towns offered bounties for Indian scalps, arms, hands, or proof of dead Indians
- Some communities paid direct compensation for evidence of kills

### Documentation

Historian Benjamin Madley documented:
- More than **370 massacres** (defined as the intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants)
- Fewer than 1,400 non-Indians killed by Indians during this period
- Madley concluded: "It was genocide, sanctioned and facilitated by California officials" who "established a state-sponsored killing machine"

**2019 Recognition:**
Governor Gavin Newsom established a Truth and Healing Council to examine California's historical relationship with Native Americans and issued an apology for the state's role in the genocide.

## 6. Plains Wars (1860-1890)

### Sand Creek Massacre (November 29, 1864)

**Background:**
- Black Kettle's Cheyenne and Arapaho band had sought peace

- 53 women and children captured as hostages and human shields

**Modern Recognition:**
- The Washita Battlefield National Historic Site was created in 1996
- Modern Cheyenne consider it a massacre and campaign to change the site's name

### Buffalo Extermination as Weapon

**The Strategy:**
Generals William T. Sherman and Philip Sheridan believed that eliminating the buffalo would force Plains Indians to surrender. This was a deliberate application of Sherman's "scorched earth" Civil War tactics.

**Official Statements:**

**Colonel Dodge (1867):** "Every buffalo dead is an Indian gone."

**Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano (1872):** "The rapid disappearance of game from the former hunting-grounds must operate largely in favor of our efforts to confine the Indians to smaller areas, and compel them to abandon their nomadic customs."

**General Philip Sheridan (opposing Texas protection legislation):** "These men have done more in the last two years, and will do more in the next year, to settle the vexed Indian question, than the entire regular army has done in the last forty years. They are destroying the Indians' commissary."

**Federal Actions:**
- 1874: President Ulysses S. Grant **pocket vetoed** a federal bill to protect bison herds
- 1875: General Sheridan pleaded to a joint session of Congress to slaughter the herds
- U.S. Army actively supported mass killings, providing ammunition to hunters

**The Slaughter:**
- Pre-slaughter population: 50-60 million buffalo

**Casualties:**
- **250-300 Lakota killed** (some estimates higher)
- Most were women and children
- 4 men and 47 women and children wounded (some died later)
- 25 U.S. soldiers killed (many from friendly fire)

**Aftermath:**
- U.S. Army awarded **31 Medals of Honor** for this campaign
- **19 specifically for service at Wounded Knee**
- Marked the end of Plains peoples' armed resistance
- Bodies left on the field for days; mass grave dug

## 7. Cultural Genocide: The Boarding School System

### "Kill the Indian, Save the Man"

This phrase, coined by **Lieutenant Richard Henry Pratt**, founder of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School (1879), encapsulated the assimilationist philosophy:

- Forcibly remove children from families
- Strip away language, religion, and cultural practices
- Replace with English and Christianity
- Prepare for manual labor

### The Scale of the System

**United States:**
- Over **400 federally-operated boarding schools** documented
- System operated from 1877 to 1978 (over a century)
- Children as young as **4 years old** taken

**Federal Investigation (2022):**
- At least **500 Native children died** while forcibly attending schools
- At least **53 burial sites** documented at federally-operated schools
- Investigators expect additional sites to be identified

### Conditions and Abuse

**Carlisle Indian School Example:**
- First year: 6 of 136 students died on campus
- 15 more sent home to die
- Unsanitary practices (shared instrument mouthpieces without cleaning)
- Poor nutrition made students susceptible to tuberculosis, pneumonia, influenza, diphtheria, typhoid

**Systemic Problems:**
- Children forbidden to speak their languages
- Punished for practicing traditional religion
- Physical abuse widespread
- **Sexual abuse epidemic** documented
- Inadequate food, heating, and medical care

### Death Rates

- Government study (1909) found death rates at some schools were **20 times the national average**
- Bodies often not returned to families
- Families not informed of circumstances of death

### Canada Comparison

- **139 residential schools** operated until 1998
- Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified over 3,000 documented deaths
- Estimated true number: **6,000-25,000 deaths**
- 2021: Detection of **200+ unmarked graves** at one school
- **751 unmarked graves** at Marieval Indian Residential School, Saskatchewan

### Generational Trauma

Interior Secretary Deb Haaland's statement: "The consequences of federal Indian boarding school policies - including the intergenerational trauma caused by the family separation and cultural eradication inflicted upon generations of children as young as 4 years old - are heartbreaking and undeniable."

## 8. The Reservation System and Land Theft

### The Reservation System

- Forced relocation to land deemed undesirable by white settlers
- Concentration of diverse peoples onto small areas
- Destruction of traditional subsistence patterns
- Dependency on government rations (often inadequate or withheld)

### The Dawes Act (1887) - Land Theft Through "Allotment"

**The Mechanism:**
- Authorized President to subdivide tribal communal lands into individual allotments
- 160 acres of farmland or 320 acres of grazing land per family head
- 25-year trust period before full ownership
- "Surplus" lands opened to white settlement

**The Theft:**
- **1887:** 138 million acres of tribal land
- **1934:** 48 million acres remaining
- **Loss: 90 million acres** - approximately two-thirds of tribal land base
- **90,000 Native Americans made landless**

**How Land Was Lost:**
- After 25-year trust period, land became subject to state and local property taxes
- Most Indigenous landowners couldn't pay taxes
- Land seized by tax courts and sold at auction
- "White people literally waiting in line for the land to go into forfeiture"
- Tribes often underpaid for allotments
- Non-accepting allotments sold to non-Natives

**Continuing Effects:**
- Fractionated ownership of land title
- Checkerboard ownership patterns on reservations
- Loss of access to sacred sites

### The Termination Era (1940s-1960s)

**House Concurrent Resolution 108 (1953):**
- Announced federal policy of termination
- Goal: End federal recognition of tribes as sovereign nations

**Effects:**
- More than **100 tribes and bands** lost federal recognition
- Affected over **12,000 Native Americans** (3% of total population)
- **2.5 million acres** removed from protected status
- Tribal governments dismantled
- Federal services ended

**Relocation Programs:**
- BIA Relocation Program started 1948
- Peak: 7,000 relocations in 1957
- By 1960: **33,466 people relocated** to urban areas
- Many faced discrimination, unemployment, loss of cultural supports

**End of Termination:**
- Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (1975)
- Explicitly recognized tribal right to self-governance
- Some terminated tribes have been restored

---

## 9. Every Treaty Broken

### The Pattern

Between 1778 and 1871, the United States entered into **over 500 treaties** with Indigenous nations.

**Every single one was violated.**

Treaties were used as a means to:
1. Temporarily placate Indigenous resistance
2. Gain land cessions through coercion
3. Break agreements when profitable for the government or settlers

### Specific Examples

**Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868):**
- Guaranteed Lakota ownership of the Black Hills (sacred land)
- Gold discovered; U.S. renegotiated and took the land by force
- Resistance led to Battle of Little Bighorn (1876)
- 1980: Supreme Court ruled Black Hills were illegally confiscated
- Awarded over $100 million in reparations
- **Sioux leaders rejected the payment** - "the land was never for sale"
- Controversy continues to this day

**Dakota Treaties:**
- Dakota people believed treaty payments would be delivered in full and on time
- Broken treaties resulted in hunger, distress, and desperation
- After Dakota uprising of 1862: All treaties nullified
- Tribal lands sold
- Treaty payments redirected to settlers as "war reparations"

**End of Treaty-Making (1871):**
Congress declared: "henceforth, no Indian nation or tribe...shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation."

### The Trail of Broken Treaties (1972)

A cross-country caravan from West Coast to Department of Interior headquarters in Washington, D.C., demanded:
- Restoration of tribes' treaty-making authority
- Abolition of Bureau of Indian Affairs
- Federal investment in jobs, housing, and education

The caravan drew attention to the government's failure to uphold its treaty obligations.

## 10. Modern Continuation

### Standing Rock and the Dakota Access Pipeline (2016)

**Background:**
- $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile pipeline through four states
- Original route crossed Missouri River 10 miles north of Bismarck
- Route rejected due to proximity to Bismarck's (predominantly white) water supply
- Rerouted to cross near Standing Rock Sioux Reservation
- Critics call this **environmental racism**

**Treaty Violations:**
- Construction violated the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868
- Recognized Sioux right to land the pipeline trespasses

**The Protests:**
- Sacred Stone Camp established April 1, 2016
- Largest gathering of Native Americans in more than 100 years
- Youth-led campaign "ReZpect Our Water"
- Water protectors from across the country and Canada

**Law Enforcement Response:**
- Automatic rifles, sound cannons, concussion grenades used against water protectors
- Water cannons used for hours in subfreezing temperatures
- Approximately 300 protesters injured

**Outcome:**
- December 2016: Army Corps denied easement for Lake Oahe crossing
- Victory later reversed under Trump administration
- Pipeline currently operational despite ongoing legal challenges

### Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW)

**Statistics:**
- More than **84.3%** of American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in their lifetime
- **56.1%** have experienced sexual violence
- Over **1.5 million** AI/AN women have experienced violence
- On some reservations: Murder rates **more than 10 times** the national average
- Homicide is the **third leading cause of death** for AI/AN females ages 10-24

**Missing Persons:**
- 2016: **5,712 missing Indigenous women and girls** reported to National Crime Information Center
- Department of Justice federal database: Only **116 cases** recorded
- AI/AN people are 3.5% of missing persons but only 1.1% of population

**Root Causes:**
- Legacy of forced removal, land seizures, and government violence
- Jurisdictional gaps between federal, state, and tribal authorities
- Loss of sovereignty and cultural identity
- Underreporting and racial misclassification
- Resource extraction "man camps" in some areas

**Government Response:**
- 2021: Missing and Murdered Unit established by Interior Department
- May 5th declared National Day of Awareness for MMIW (2017)
- Multiple states passing legislation

### Ongoing Sovereignty Issues

- Land and resource extraction on treaty lands
- Water rights disputes
- Religious site protection
- Mascot controversies
- Repatriation of remains and sacred objects
- Climate change impacts on Indigenous communities
- Continued jurisdictional confusion

## Conclusion

The destruction of Indigenous peoples in what became the United States represents one of the greatest demographic catastrophes in human history. From an estimated population of 2.5-18 million at contact, Indigenous peoples were reduced to approximately 237,000 by 1900 - a loss of 95-99%.

This was not the inevitable result of "civilization's advance" or purely the consequence of disease. It was the product of:

- **Deliberate extermination campaigns** with explicit genocidal intent (California, Sand Creek)
- **State-sponsored scalp bounties** on men, women, and children
- **Forced removals** resulting in mass death (Trail of Tears, Long Walk)
- **Treaty violations** that enabled continuous land theft
- **Cultural genocide** through boarding schools and forced assimilation
- **Economic warfare** through buffalo extermination
- **Legal dispossession** through the Dawes Act and Termination policies

The effects continue today in ongoing sovereignty battles, the MMIW crisis, and the intergenerational trauma from centuries of violence and cultural destruction.

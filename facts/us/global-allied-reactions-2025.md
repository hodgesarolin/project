## Executive Summary

The second Trump administration, inaugurated January 20, 2025, has fundamentally reshaped America's relationships with its traditional allies. Characterized by unprecedented tariff actions, demands for dramatically increased defense spending, and transactional diplomacy, the administration's policies have triggered significant policy shifts across allied nations. Global public opinion of the United States has declined sharply, while countries have accelerated efforts to reduce dependence on the US through trade diversification and new alliances.

## European Reactions

### European Union Official Response

#### Tariff Timeline and Actions

On April 2, 2025, President Trump announced sweeping tariffs dubbed "Liberation Day," imposing a 20% levy on EU goods in response to a claimed $300 billion trade deficit. The EU countered with its own figures showing a broadly balanced relationship. [Source: Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/)

**EU Countermeasures:**
- April 1, 2025: EU reinstated previously suspended rebalancing tariffs from 2018 and 2020, including 10-50% duties on iconic US products
- The European Commission proposed new countermeasures covering EUR 18-21 billion in additional US imports, including soybeans, corn, fruit, wood, and textiles
- April 10, 2025: EU announced a 90-day pause on countermeasures to facilitate negotiations [Source: Cleary Trade Watch](https://www.clearytradewatch.com/2025/04/the-eus-latest-response-to-trump-ii-tariffs/)

#### Framework Agreement (July 2025)

On July 27, 2025, the United States and European Union announced a trade framework agreement following a meeting between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

**Key Terms:**
- US will apply a 15% tariff to most imports from the EU (down from threatened 30%)
- The 15% rate acts as an all-inclusive tariff "ceiling" - distinguishing the EU deal from all others concluded
- EU pledged to significantly increase US energy imports, including LNG purchases worth up to $750 billion by 2028
- Von der Leyen called the deal "a stabilizing step for the global economy" [Source: Covington](https://www.cov.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2025/08/us--eu-trade-framework-outcome-and-next-steps)

#### Ongoing Tensions (Late 2025)

On December 16, 2025, Washington warned of potential penalties targeting EU services and technology regulations, accusing Brussels of discriminatory treatment against US firms such as Google, Amazon, Meta, and X. The US announced bans on five individuals from entering the country, including former European Commissioner Thierry Breton.

### Germany

#### Initial Response Under Chancellor Scholz

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz voiced opposition to Trump's call for NATO members to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP:

> "That's a lot of money... Five percent of our GDP would be over EUR 200 billion ($204 billion) per year, our federal budget is currently less than 500 billion." [Source: Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/01/13/scholz-rejects-trumps-5-nato-spending-demand-far-too-costly.html)

Germany hit the 2% target for the first time in 2024, after Scholz promised a complete overhaul of the country's military in 2022, breaking years of taboo against heavy military investment. [Source: Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/08/german-politicians-rebuke-trump-over-nato-defence-spending-demand)

#### Policy Shift Under Chancellor Merz

Germany under new Chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised NATO allies by signaling plans to massively boost defense spending to 5% of GDP as demanded by Trump.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul stated:
> "And the result is indeed the 5% demanded by President Trump, that he believes are necessary, and we are following him in this respect." [Source: CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/germany-backs-trumps-push-for-5percent-nato-defense-spending-target.html)

**Historic Defense Spending Reform (March 2025):**
German lawmakers approved a historic shift to exempt defense and security spending beyond 1% of GDP from debt limits, enabling a EUR 500 billion fund for defense and infrastructure. Germany is the top spender in Europe in absolute terms, spending EUR 90.6 billion (2.12% of GDP) in 2024.

### NATO

#### Defense Spending Response

**5% GDP Target:**
NATO allies (besides Spain) committed to make a 5% GDP spending pledge. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte stated this was "a quantum leap that is ambitious, historic and fundamental to securing our future." [Source: Breaking Defense](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/12/nato-allies-oppose-us-peace-deal-for-ukraine-as-fcas-falters-2025-review/)

**Current Status:**
Of NATO's 32 members, 31 are set to meet the target of spending 2% of GDP on defense in 2025 - up from just six in 2021. Poland leads as NATO's top defense spender by GDP at 4.12%, followed by Estonia at 3.43% and the US at 3.38%. [Source: NATO](https://www.nato.int/en/news-and-events/articles/news/2025/12/03/nato-foreign-ministers-reaffirm-commitment-to-defence-investment-and-ukraine-support)

#### Ukraine Concerns

**Trump's 28-Point Peace Plan:**
Trump's peace plan includes a security guarantee modeled on NATO's Article 5, committing the US and European allies to treat an attack on Ukraine as an attack on the entire "transatlantic community."

The plan calls for:
- A demilitarized zone between Ukrainian and Russian-held territory
- Russia would take control of all of the Donbas region
- Lines of control in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia would mostly be frozen
- No NATO troops on Ukrainian soil
- Ukraine's military capped at 600,000 personnel

In November, various European defense leaders and US lawmakers "scoffed" at the plan as it became clear it favored Russia. [Source: RAND](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/12/in-ukraine-is-the-us-promising-too-much.html)

#### August 2025 Alaska Summit Crisis

In August 2025, Trump held a summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska and "seemed sympathetic to Putin's territorial and other demands in Ukraine." This prompted a hastily arranged summit in Washington attended by leaders of Ukraine, the UK, Finland, France, Germany, and Italy, plus the President of the European Commission and the Secretary General of NATO, to produce a common position.

## Canada

### Trudeau Government Response

#### Initial Tariff Threat and Response

On November 25, 2024, Trump threatened 25% tariffs on all products from Canada, claiming they would "remain in effect until such time as drugs, in particular fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country." [Source: Wikipedia - 2025 Trade War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_trade_war_with_Canada_and_Mexico)

**Canadian Government Data on Fentanyl:**
- Only about 1% of fentanyl imports and illegal border crossings to the US come from Canada
- From October 2023 to October 2024: 23,000 illegal crossings from Canada vs. 1.5 million from Mexico
- Fentanyl seizures from Canada dropped 97% between December 2024 and January 2025 after Canadian countermeasures [Source: Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/international-trade-finance-policy/canadas-response-us-tariffs.html)

#### Tariff Implementation Timeline

- **February 1, 2025:** Trump declared "national emergencies" regarding fentanyl trafficking and invoked IEEPA to impose 25% tariffs on most goods from Canada
- **February 3, 2025:** Leaders negotiated a one-month delay
- **February 27, 2025:** Trump reaffirmed tariffs, claiming drugs were still arriving
- **March 4, 2025:** Tariffs took effect
- **August 2025:** Tariffs boosted to 35% as Trump complained about Canada's retaliatory tariffs and dairy sector supply management [Source: CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-canada-response-tariffs-1.7473965)

#### Canadian Retaliation

Canada retaliated with 25% tariffs on $20 billion (CA$30 billion) worth of US goods, expanding to $85 billion (CA$125 billion).

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that Trump is trying to prompt "a total collapse of the Canadian economy" because he thinks that will "make it easier to annex us." [Source: Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/6/trump-ratchets-up-tariff-tension-with-canadas-trudeau-over-border-policies)

### Political Impacts and Leadership Change

#### Trudeau's Resignation

On January 6, 2025, Prime Minister Trudeau announced his intention to step down, amid a Conservative lead of 46% to the Liberal Party's 20% in public opinion polls.

#### Mark Carney's Rise and Election Victory

Two months later, Mark Carney was elected Liberal Party leader and sworn in as prime minister. Carney, former governor of the Bank of Canada (2008-2013) and Bank of England (2013-2020), launched an election campaign centered on Trump.

**Election Results (April 28, 2025):**
Carney's Liberal Party won, with the election dominated by the Trump factor.

Professor Jon Parmenter (Cornell University):
> "President Trump single-handedly helped the Liberal Party recover from a very large popular-opinion deficit in Canada to win the election, ironically." [Source: NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/29/nx-s1-5380765/mark-carney-won-canadas-election-after-a-campaign-dominated-by-trump)

#### Carney's Stance

Carney adopted a "elbows up" approach (hockey term for fighting back), declaring on election victory that Canada would "never" yield to the United States.

At their first Oval Office meeting (May 6, 2025), Carney told Trump:
> "Canada is not for sale... won't be for sale, ever." [Source: NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/06/nx-s1-5387465/trump-carney-canada-tariffs)

### Trump's Annexation Comments

Trump made repeated calls for Canada to be annexed as the "51st state," stating that while he would not use military coercion, he could use "economic force." Trudeau characterized these comments as a serious threat against Canadian sovereignty, arguing Trump seeks to control Canada's mineral resources. [Source: MSNBC](https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-canada-tariff-war-annex-trudeau-rcna195882)

### Current Status (Late 2025)

Canada remains the only G7 member without a trade deal to stave off punitive duties. While Trump toned down annexation talk after Carney's election, every deadline for a trade deal has passed with no clear progress.

**September 2025 Adjustment:**
Canada removed counter tariffs put in place in March 2025 on most US imports, effective September 1, 2025, in recognition of the US allowing most Canadian goods to enter tariff-free under CUSMA. However, Canada's counter tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles remain in effect as negotiations continue.

## Mexico

### Government Response (President Sheinbaum)

President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office October 1, 2024, expressed disagreement with "unilateral deportations" of Mexican nationals and Trump's "Remain in Mexico" policy, while signaling cooperation with some measures - possibly acknowledging Trump's 25% tariff threat. [Source: Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/01/24/trump-mexico-deportation-immigration-tariffs-trade-sheinbaum/)

### "Mexico Embraces You" Program

In response to deportations, Sheinbaum launched the "Mexico Embraces You" program providing:

### Military Flight Incident

On January 24, 2025, Mexico denied a US military plane access to land, temporarily frustrating deportation plans. A DHS official later clarified that the four deportation flights accepted that day were ICE Air Operations government-chartered flights, not military aircraft. [Source: NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/mexico-refuses-accept-us-deportation-flight-rcna189182)

### Position on Non-Mexican Deportees

Sheinbaum stated Mexico will accept deported Mexican citizens and those of other nationalities, aiming to eventually repatriate them. This includes migrants from countries with strained US diplomatic relations (Cuba, Venezuela). However, she stopped short of agreeing to accept foreign asylum-seekers as part of "remain in Mexico" resumption. [Source: Americas Quarterly](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/deportations-and-tariffs-are-a-stern-test-for-sheinbaum/)

### Consular Support

### Trade Relations

Mexico, along with Canada, faced 25% tariffs under Trump's February 1, 2025 executive order citing fentanyl trafficking. Mexico has firmly rejected the immigration crackdown, calling for development-based solutions instead of repression.

## Asia-Pacific Allies

### Japan

#### Initial Optimism

On February 7, 2025, Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru traveled to Washington - the second foreign leader to visit the Trump White House. The optics were positive, and Ishiba expressed confidence Japan could sidestep looming tariff hikes based on Japan's massive investments in the United States. [Source: Modern Diplomacy](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/02/12/ishiba-navigates-trumps-trade-policies-japans-strategy-to-avoid-u-s-tariffs/)

#### Tariff Escalation (July 2025)

On July 7, 2025, Trump sent a letter announcing 25% tariffs on all goods shipped to the US beginning August 1.

LDP senior member Itsunori Onodera:
> "The content is entirely unacceptable. To notify a key ally with nothing more than a single letter is extremely disrespectful, and I feel a strong sense of indignation." [Source: South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3317746/japan-refuses-yield-trumps-tariff-threat-we-will-not-be-taken-advantage)

#### Trade Deal (September 2025)

After ten trips to Washington by Japanese negotiator Ryosei Akazawa, Japan was forced to accept a compromise on July 22, 2025:
- 15% tariffs on most Japanese goods, including autos
- $550 billion Japanese investment commitment in US-selected projects
- Increased purchases of American agricultural products (corn, soybeans)
- Increased purchases of US commercial aircraft and defense equipment

[Source: CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/trum-japan-trade-deal-tariffs-ishiba-ldp-party.html)

#### Defense Spending Pressure

Trump periodically noted the US-Japan alliance is "one-sided." Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth declared the administration wants Indo-Pacific allies to raise defense spending to 5%.

Japan, already committed to doubling its defence budget from 1% to 2% of GDP by 2027, gave a "chilly reception" to Under Secretary Elbridge Colby's calls for 3.5% of GDP spending.

Ishiba maintained:
> "It is crucial to ensure that what is deemed necessary is something the taxpayers can understand and support." [Source: CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/japans-response-trump-20-sustaining-us-ties-strengthening-international-partnerships)

#### Public Opinion Collapse

**University of Tokyo Survey (August 2025):**
- Only 18% of respondents viewed the US-Japan relationship as positive (down from 45% one year earlier)

**Asahi Shimbun Survey (March 2025):**
- 77% doubted Washington would defend Japan in a crisis
- 68% advocated for greater diplomatic independence from the US

**Nippon.com Survey:**
- 42% prioritized strengthening Japan's self-defence capabilities
- 33.7% supported diversifying alliances
- 24.7% supported deepening ties with Washington

- 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum (from March 2025)
- 25% tariffs on automobiles and certain parts [Source: Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12569)

#### South Korean Strategy

South Korea adopted a "let's make a deal" attitude rather than retaliation:
- Did not criticize its ally
- Did not retaliate with own tariff increases
- Reached out proactively to identify deal terms

President Lee characterized Trump's trade war as threatening South Korea's "survival." [Source: Press TV](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/06/04/749208/South-Korea-president-warn-global-trade-chaos-Trump-tariffs-threaten-survival)

#### Trade Deal (July 31, 2025)

- 15% tariff on South Korean goods (down from threatened 25%)
- Auto tariffs also cut to 15%
- South Korea committed $350 billion in US investments ($150 billion focused on shipbuilding)
- Investments to help South Korean companies enter US market in semiconductors and biotech

### Australia

#### Tariff Impact

Australia, one of the closest US allies, was slapped with:
- 10% baseline tariff as part of "reciprocal" duties (April 1, 2025)
- 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum

[Source: CFR](https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/trump-tariffs-australia-and-new-zealand-risk-us-pacific-strategy)

#### Albanese's Response

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the tariffs as "unwarranted," stating:
> "The Administration's tariffs have no basis in logic - and they go against the basis of our two nations' partnership... not the act of a friend." [Source: Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/04/03/australia-trump-tariffs-albanese-norfolk-island/)

#### October 2025 White House Meeting

Trump and Albanese signed a critical minerals agreement at the White House:
- US and Australian governments plan to invest more than $3 billion together in critical mineral projects in the next six months
- Recoverable resources estimated to be worth over $50 billion

When asked about lifting tariffs on Australia, Trump stated:
> "Australia pays very low tariffs, very, very low tariffs. Australia pays among the lowest tariffs." [Source: NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/trump-albanese-australia-critical-minerals-aukus-submarine-china-rcna238595)

#### AUKUS Under Scrutiny

The roughly 70-year-old formal alliance has been "upended" by tariffs. The AUKUS agreement faced particular scrutiny following:
- Pentagon review into alignment with Trump's America First agenda
- Doubling of tariffs for steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, when asked why tariffs apply to Australia despite a free trade agreement and trade deficit, stated the US "should be running up the score on Australia." [Source: Lowy Institute](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/albanese-must-learn-smiles-handshakes-trump-won-t-save-australia-s-aukus-ambitions)

#### Public Opinion Shift

Australia Institute Poll (2025):
- 48% of respondents believe AUKUS makes Australia more safe
- 56.8% support a Parliamentary Inquiry into AUKUS
- Over half of Australians now support pursuit of a more independent foreign policy - up 10% in just a few months

When asked in February 2025 about any commitment to defend Taiwan, Trump said:
> "I never comment on that. I don't want to ever put myself in that position."

This essentially continues the long-standing US policy of strategic ambiguity. [Source: FPRI](https://www.fpri.org/article/2025/05/the-return-to-strategic-ambiguity-assessing-trumps-taiwan-stance/)

#### Defense Spending Demands

Trump criticized Taiwan's defense spending (currently less than 3% of GDP), demanding it be raised to 10%. Under Secretary Elbridge Colby reiterated this figure during his confirmation hearing. [Source: RAND](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/03/from-strategic-ambiguity-to-strategic-anxiety-taiwans.html)

#### TSMC $100 Billion Investment

Trump announced that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) plans to invest $100 billion in new US manufacturing facilities. This has divided Taiwan politically.

Opposition lawmaker Fu Kun-chi asked:
> "If TSMC turns into 'American Semiconductor Manufacturing Company', where will Taiwan's security be then?"

Former President Ma Ying-jeou accused President Lai Ching-te of "selling" TSMC to Trump, calling it a "major national security crisis." [Source: NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/g-s1-53275/taiwan-tsmc-us-investments-security-worries)

#### "Silicon Shield" Concerns

Taiwan produces 60% of the world's semiconductors. There is worry that TSMC's expansion abroad will dilute the company's power at home, making the US less inclined to feel Taiwan is worthy of defense. TSMC's investments in the US have come with no guarantees for Taiwan in return.

#### Chinese Pressure Intensifying

Beijing is intensifying pressure on Taiwan:
- Chinese fighter jets and naval vessels testing Taiwan's defenses
- Chinese vessels implicated in severing Taiwan's undersea telecommunications cables

If Taiwan falls under Beijing's control, China would gain:
- Control of the world's most advanced semiconductor manufacturer
- Increased ability to dominate Pacific trade routes through East and South China Seas
- Military pressure leverage on US treaty allies Japan, Philippines, and Australia

## Expert and Academic Assessments

### TRIP Survey of IR Scholars (May 2025)

The Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) Project surveyed 726 international relations scholars at US colleges and universities on Trump's first 100 days.

**Key Findings:**
- Respondents overwhelmingly negative about Trump's foreign-policy performance
- Experts expressed Trump's choices have made the US:
  - Less secure
  - Less respected abroad
  - Less able to achieve its goals on the global stage
- Conclusion: The world will be less peaceful and less stable in months and years ahead
- 93% disapprove of Trump's handling of Russia's war in Ukraine
- 64% said Trump's Ukraine policy would increase the odds of Chinese aggression against Taiwan

### Middle East Institute Assessment

> "Six months into his second term, President Donald Trump remains in search of a major, concrete foreign policy win. Trump 2.0's foreign policy is still struggling to produce a major positive outcome from its frenetic activity trying to end kinetic wars while prosecuting an unprecedented economic war with much of the rest of the world."

[Source: Middle East Institute](https://www.mei.edu/publications/us-policy-middle-east-second-quarter-2025-report-card)

### Characterization of Foreign Policy

The second Trump administration's foreign policy has been described as:
- Imperialist and expansionist in approach to the Americas
- Isolationist in approach to Europe
- Espousing a realist "America First" agenda
- Expansive version of the Monroe Doctrine
- Likened to President William McKinley's foreign policy
- Breaking the post-1945 rules-based liberal international order
- Abandoning multilateralism

[Source: Wikipedia - Foreign Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_second_Trump_administration)

### National Security Strategy Analysis

**Stimson Center Expert Assessment:**
> "The 2025 NSS replaces one unsustainable vision of primacy with another. Civilizational nationalism will fail just as liberal internationalism failed - not simply because the values differ, but because comprehensive dominance exceeds American means."

**Chinese Reaction:**
China's reaction to the new NSS has been "overwhelmingly positive." China identifies a turn from great power competition to a balance of power strategy. The Trump administration has narrowed the definition of US national interests, which Beijing views as significantly reducing US-China clash points.

## Overview

This document tracks how states are resisting federal overreach and potential authoritarianism, examining historical precedent, current actions, legal strategies, and constitutional limitations.

---

## Historical Precedent

### The Nullification Doctrine

The concept of state resistance to federal authority has deep roots in American history:

- **Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions (1798):** James Madison and Thomas Jefferson argued states could declare federal laws unconstitutional
- **South Carolina Nullification Crisis (1832-33):** States claimed the right to invalidate federal tariffs
- **Anti-slavery resistance:** Northern states used "personal liberty laws" to resist the Fugitive Slave Act

> [!note] Historical Pattern
> Research identified over 1,500 nullification-related proposals introduced in state legislatures from 2010-2016 alone. [Source: Scholars Strategy Network](https://scholars.org/contribution/nullification-growing-form-resistance-federal)

### The Original Sanctuary Movement (1980s)

The modern sanctuary movement originated in the 1980s as a religious and political response to federal immigration policy:

**Key Facts:**
- 500+ congregations declared themselves "sanctuaries" for Central American refugees
- San Francisco passed the first "sanctuary city" ordinance in **1985**
- Faith-based groups in the Southwest initiated the movement in March 1982 with eight churches publicly declaring sanctuary status

**Federal Response:**
- FBI and INS surveillance of congregations
- Infiltration of Bible studies and placement of spies in parish pews
- **Operation Sojourner (1985):** 10-month investigation using paid informants
- Criminal prosecutions in Texas and Arizona

> [!important] Constitutional Distinction
> Scholars distinguish between "nullification" (states claiming power to invalidate federal law) and "interposition" (states placing themselves between citizens and federal enforcement). Modern sanctuary policies are better understood as the latter. [Source: Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/policy-report/september/october-2021/sanctuaries-nullification-commandeering)

- Maintained the **California Values Act (SB 54)** as binding law
- Withdrew four Clean Air Act waiver requests in January 2025 to prevent federal interference

**Quote from AG Bonta:**
> "The weaponization of the Congressional Review Act to attack California's waivers is just another part of the continuous, partisan campaign against California's efforts to protect the public and the planet from harmful pollution."

## Environmental Resistance

### California's Clean Air Act Waiver Battle

**Background:**
California alone can request EPA waivers to enforce stricter vehicle emission standards than federal law.

**Biden Administration Waivers Granted (January 2025):**
- Advanced Clean Cars II
- Heavy-Duty Low NOX Omnibus
- Small Off-Road Engine amendments
- In-Use Off-Road Diesel-Fueled Fleets amendments

**California's Strategic Withdrawal (January 13, 2025):**
CARB withdrew waiver requests for four regulations due to "uncertainty caused by the impending change in federal administration":
- Advanced Clean Fleets Regulations
- In-Use Locomotive Regulations
- Parts of Commercial Harbor Craft and Ocean-Going Vessels At-Berth Regulations
- Parts of Transport Refrigeration Unit Engine Standards Regulations

**Trump Administration Response (February 2025):**
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced EPA would seek to repeal Biden-era waivers via Congressional Review Act.

**Congressional Review Act Resolutions (June 12, 2025):**
Three CRA resolutions signed by Trump rescinded:
1. ACC II Rule (EV mandate: 35% in 2026 to 100% by 2035)
2. Advanced Clean Trucks Rule
3. Heavy-duty omnibus rule (NOX restrictions)

**Senate Override:**
Senate voted 51-44 to overturn California's waiver, overruling the parliamentarian (only done handful of times in 90-year history of role).

**Legal Challenge:**
11 states filed suit the same day seeking to invalidate waiver rescissions, arguing CRA doesn't apply to "adjudicatory orders."

[Sources: Jones Day](https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2025/08/active-battle-over-the-california-clean-air-act-waiver-continues), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/nx-s1-5387729/senate-california-ev-air-pollution-waiver-revoked)

### Federal EPA Rollbacks (2025)

**March 12, 2025 - Zeldin Announcement:**
- Intent to repeal 2015 Obama-era GHG standards for power plants
- Intent to repeal 2024 Biden-era rule for new and existing plants

**June 2025 Proposed Rule:**
- Rescind 2015 NSPS and 2024 CPS for fossil fuel-fired power plants
- Eliminate federal GHG emissions limits entirely
- Proposed finding that GHG emissions do NOT contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution

**Solar for All Program:**
- February 2025: Trump Administration froze $7 billion program
- August 2025: EPA terminated all 60 grants

### State Climate Policy Resistance

**Multi-State Lawsuit on "Energy Emergency":**
15 state AGs (including Minnesota and Oregon) challenged Trump's executive order declaring "national energy emergency" under the National Emergencies Act.

**State Renewable Energy Mandates:**
At least 6 states (California, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New York, Oregon) have enacted legislation requiring pension funds to divest from fossil fuel companies.

**DOJ Lawsuits Against States (May 1, 2025):**
Justice Department announced lawsuits against four state climate policies.

## Legal Strategies

### State Attorney General Coalitions

**By the Numbers (One Year Into Trump's Second Term):**
- **71 lawsuits** filed by Democratic AGs
- **40 wins** out of 51 resolved cases (78% win rate)
- **300+ lawsuits** filed against administration through July 2025
- ~40 of these filed by state AGs

**Most Active AG:**
Oregon AG Dan Rayfield: Led or joined **52 lawsuits**

### Key Coalition Lawsuits

**Federal Funding Freeze:**
- Led by NY AG Letitia James
- Coalition of 22 state AGs
- **WIN:** US District Court for District of Rhode Island granted preliminary injunction

**CFPB Defunding:**
- 21 states + DC sued to prevent CFPB defunding
- Led by NY AG James

**Immigration Conditions on Funding:**
- 19 AGs filed two separate lawsuits

### Court Venues and Strategy

**Favorable Circuits:**
- **First Circuit (Boston):** All Democratic appointees at appellate level
- Early rulings blocked birthright citizenship order, funding freezes

**Challenge:**
Universal/nationwide injunction strategy complicated by June 2025 Supreme Court ruling (Trump v. CASA).

### Supreme Court Ruling on Nationwide Injunctions

**Trump v. CASA, Inc. (June 27, 2025):**
6-3 ruling sharply curtailed universal injunctions.

**Impact:**
- 35 of 40 nationwide injunctions against Trump came from 5 jurisdictions (CA, MD, MA, WA, DC)
- Future litigation shifting to **class action** strategy under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23

**2025 Emergency Docket:**
- 24 rulings on Trump administration actions
- Administration won 20, lost 4

**Key Loss for Trump:**
- **A.A.R.P. v. Trump:** 7-2 blocked use of Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to El Salvador
- **Trump v. Illinois (December 23, 2025):** 6-3 ruled Trump lacked authority to federalize Illinois National Guard

## Economic Resistance

### State Pension Fund Decisions

**Pro-ESG States (Fossil Fuel Divestment Mandates):**
California, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New York, Oregon

**Example:** New York City's pension fund surpassed climate emissions targets despite federal rollbacks.

**Anti-ESG States (Banning ESG Considerations):**
Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana

**Examples of Anti-ESG Actions:**
- Florida: $2 billion divestment from BlackRock
- Indiana PURS: Voted to stop using BlackRock (December 2024)
- Texas Permanent School Fund: Pulled ~$8.5 billion from BlackRock (March 2024)

### Federal ESG Policy Reversal

**May 28, 2025:**
DOL announced abandonment of 2022 ESG rule in favor of Trump-era stance (ESG only as tiebreaker).

**Economic Costs of Anti-ESG Policies:**
- Texas anti-ESG laws cost $700+ million in 2022-23 (Texas Association of Business)
- Divesting from BlackRock and State Street would cost OPERS ~$10 million

### State Procurement and Economic Pressure

**California:**
- Earmarking funds for litigation against Trump administration
- Governor Newsom's special session included "Trump-proofing" measures

**Illinois:**
- Governor Pritzker directed state divestment from El Salvador
- Expanded state-funded immigrant legal defense programs

## Constitutional Framework and Limitations

### The Supremacy Clause

> "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof... shall be the supreme Law of the Land." - Article VI, Clause 2

**Core Principle:**
Federal law takes priority over conflicting state law when Congress acts within constitutional authority.

**Limitations:**
- Federal law must be within enumerated powers
- Cannot violate Bill of Rights (especially 10th Amendment)
- Cannot improperly impinge on state sovereignty

### The Anti-Commandeering Doctrine

**Definition:**
Federal government cannot compel states to administer federal programs or enforce federal law.

**Key Supreme Court Cases:**

| Case | Year | Holding |
|------|------|---------|
| New York v. United States | 1992 | Congress cannot require states to enact/enforce federal regulatory programs |
| Printz v. United States | 1997 | Cannot conscript state officers to administer federal programs (struck down Brady Act background check requirement) |
| Murphy v. NCAA | 2018 | Cannot order state legislatures to enact/not repeal state laws |

**Printz Quote:**
> "The Federal Government may neither issue directives requiring the States to address particular problems, nor command the States' officers... to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program."

### Application to Immigration

**What States CAN Do:**
- Decline to share information with federal authorities
- Refuse to honor ICE detainers
- Limit cooperation to serious criminal cases
- Create "sensitive location" protections

**What States CANNOT Do:**
- Actively obstruct federal officers
- Harbor individuals from federal enforcement
- Prevent federal agents from operating

**Court Holdings:**
Courts have consistently protected sanctuary policies under anti-commandeering doctrine.

### Federal Funding Leverage

**South Dakota v. Dole (1987) Requirements:**
Federal funding conditions must:
1. Be unambiguously established
2. Be germane to federal interest in the program
3. Not violate other constitutional provisions
4. Not cross line from enticement to coercion

**Court Rulings on Immigration Funding Conditions:**
- First, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits all ruled DOJ exceeded authority in conditioning Byrne Justice Assistance Grants on immigration cooperation
- Found such conditions violated separation of powers (infringed on Congress's spending authority)

**Bottom Line:**
> "The Trump administration cannot force state and local law enforcement officers to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Nor can the Trump administration do this by cutting off federal law enforcement money." - Lawfare

### What States Cannot Do

1. **Override Valid Federal Law:** When federal law is constitutional and preemptive, states must comply
2. **Actively Obstruct Federal Officers:** Interference with federal agents can be criminal
3. **Ignore Federal Court Orders:** Federal judiciary decisions are binding
4. **Control Military/Federal Forces:** National Guard can be federalized (though Trump v. Illinois limited this)
5. **Print Currency or Conduct Foreign Policy:** Exclusive federal powers
6. **Violate Interstate Commerce Clause:** States cannot unduly burden interstate commerce

### Ongoing Legal Questions

1. Can Congress design funding conditions that compel cooperation without violating anti-commandeering?
2. How far can states go before running afoul of intergovernmental immunity?
3. What happens when state "shield" laws conflict with federal warrants?
4. Can states create true "sanctuaries" from federal law, or only decline active cooperation?

## Analysis and Observations

### Patterns of Resistance

1. **Legal Defense as Primary Tool:** State AGs have become the frontline, with 71+ lawsuits and 78% win rate
2. **Coalition Approach:** States acting together for greater impact
3. **Codification Strategy:** States converting federal protections to state law before federal rollback
4. **Shield Law Model:** Proven effective for healthcare, now expanding to other areas
5. **Sensitive Location Protections:** Creating specific zones immune from federal enforcement

### Effectiveness Assessment

**What's Working:**
- Anti-commandeering doctrine protects non-cooperation
- Courts initially favorable, especially in First, Seventh, Ninth Circuits
- Public opinion supports many protective measures (70% for marriage equality)
- Telehealth shields enabling cross-border abortion access

**Challenges:**
- Supreme Court limiting universal injunctions
- Federal funding leverage remains potent threat
- Conservative courts increasingly deferential to executive power
- State budgets dependent on federal dollars (28% in WA)

### Historical Parallels

> [!warning] Important Distinction
> Unlike 1830s nullification (which led to Civil War) or 1950s massive resistance (which courts struck down), current state resistance largely works *within* constitutional bounds by:
> - Declining to actively assist (not obstructing)
> - Using court challenges (not defiance)
> - Creating state alternatives (not nullifying federal law)

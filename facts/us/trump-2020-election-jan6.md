# Part I: The 2020 Election and "The Big Lie"

## Pre-Election Fraud Claims

### Timeline of False Claims

Donald Trump began laying the groundwork for election fraud claims months before any votes were cast:

**April 7, 2020**: Trump made one of his first false claims about mail-in ballot security, stating "Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they're cheaters." [Source: [NPR Timeline](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/08/965342252/timeline-what-trump-told-supporters-for-months-before-they-attacked)]

**May 2020**: Trump and his campaign strongly opposed mail-in voting, claiming it would cause widespread voter fraud - a belief debunked by numerous media organizations and election experts. [Source: [Wikipedia - False Claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_claims_of_fraud_in_the_2020_presidential_election)]

**July 2020**: Trump declined to commit to accepting election results, telling Fox News anchor Chris Wallace: "I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no." [Source: [ABC News Timeline](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-donald-trumps-election-denial-claims-republican-politicians/story?id=89168408)]

**August 2020**: Trump warned that "the only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged." He repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power. [Source: [NPR Timeline](https://www.npr.org/2021/02/08/965342252/timeline-what-trump-told-supporters-for-months-before-they-attacked)]

**September 2020**: Trump stated: "Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peacefulâthere won't be a transfer, frankly." [Source: [Wikipedia - Republican Reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_reactions_to_Donald_Trump's_claims_of_2020_election_fraud)]

## Election Night and "Stop the Count"

### The Premature Victory Declaration

**November 3-4, 2020**: Shortly before 2:30 a.m. EST on election night, while votes were still being legally counted, Trump made a speech from the White House falsely asserting victory:

> "This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election."

[Source: [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/overview-trump-calls-vote-counting-stop-path-victory/story?id=74038071)]

### "STOP THE COUNT!"

**November 5, 2020**: Trump tweeted in all capital letters: "STOP THE COUNT!"

He added (in a message flagged by Twitter as potentially misleading): "ANY VOTE THAT CAME IN AFTER ELECTION DAY WILL NOT BE COUNTED!"

This contradicted his own campaign's argument that vote counting in Arizona (where he was leading) should continue. [Source: [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/overview-trump-calls-vote-counting-stop-path-victory/story?id=74038071)]

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell noted: "Claiming you've won the election is different from finishing the counting." [Source: [FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/the-facts-on-trumps-post-election-legal-challenges/)]

## The "Big Lie" - Specific False Claims

### Dominion Voting Machines Conspiracy

Trump repeatedly claimed that Dominion Voting Systems equipment "switched votes" and "rigged" the election. Key facts:

- Trump tweeted or retweeted false claims about Dominion **more than 30 times** between Election Day and January 6th
- Claims falsely implicated Hugo Chavez, George Soros, and the Clinton Foundation
- Attorney General William Barr told Trump on December 1st that "the stuff his people were shoveling out to the public was bullshit" and that Dominion claims were "idiotic"
- The Department of Homeland Security's CISA released a statement calling the 2020 election "the most secure in American history"
- CISA stated: "There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."

### Legal Consequences for Dominion Claims
Dominion successfully sued media outlets and individuals who spread these false claims for defamation. Fox News settled with Dominion for $787.5 million.

### Dead Voters and Other Claims

Trump alleged that dead people voted "in significant numbers" - claims that were repeatedly debunked:

- An Associated Press investigation found **fewer than 475 cases of potential voter fraud** in six battleground states out of more than 25 million votes cast
- Arizona had the highest with 198 cases out of 3.4 million votes - less than 2% of Biden's margin of victory
- Georgia officials investigated claims of 66,000 underage voters and found **zero**
- Claims of 2,423 unregistered voters found **zero**
- Claims of 2,056 felons voting found **fewer than 74**

## The 60+ Court Cases Lost

### Overview of Legal Failures

Trump and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging election results. The outcome was devastating to their claims:

- **61 of 62 courts** rejected their claims
- **Only 1 minor victory**: A Pennsylvania case about ballot curing deadlines that did not affect the outcome
- **20 cases** dismissed before a hearing on the merits
- **14 cases** dropped by Trump and supporters
- **30 cases** dismissed after a hearing on the merits
- **38 Republican-appointed judges** were among the 86 judges who rejected lawsuits

### Notable Judicial Statements

**Judge Stephanos Bibas** (Trump appointee, 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals), dismissing a Pennsylvania challenge:
> "Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here."

[Source: [Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trumps-judicial-campaign-to-upend-the-2020-election-a-failure-but-not-a-wipe-out/)]

### The "Lost, Not Stolen" Report

A report by prominent conservatives examined all cases and concluded:
> "There is absolutely no evidence of fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election on the magnitude necessary to shift the result in any state, let alone the nation as a whole. In fact, there was no fraud that changed the outcome in even a single precinct."

[Source: [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/politics/conservatives-report-trump-2020-election-claims/index.html)]

### In-Court Admissions

In court (as opposed to press conferences), Trump's lawyers made revealing admissions:
- Trump campaign lawyer Kory Langhofer stated he was "not alleging fraud" or "that anyone is stealing the election"
- Instead, he raised concerns about a "limited number of cases" involving "good faith errors"

## The Georgia Phone Call: "Find 11,780 Votes"

### The Call

**Date**: January 2, 2021
**Duration**: Approximately one hour
**Participants**: President Trump, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, Georgia Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs, and lawyers

### The Key Quote

Trump told Raffensperger:
> "What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state."

This was exactly one vote more than Biden's margin of victory in Georgia. [Source: [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html)]

### Trump's Threats

During the call, Trump falsely suggested that Raffensperger could have committed a criminal offense by refusing to overturn the state's election results. [Source: [Wikipedia - Trump-Raffensperger Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrumpâRaffensperger_phone_call)]

### Raffensperger's Response

Raffensperger responded: "What I knew is that we didn't have any votes to find. That was an accurate count that had been certified." [Source: [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/21/1106472863/georgia-officials-fact-check-infamous-trump-phone-call-in-real-time)]

### Legal Consequences

- The call was cited in Trump's second impeachment article
- Fulton County prosecutors opened a criminal investigation
- Trump was indicted in Georgia in August 2023 (case later dismissed following Trump's return to office)

## DOJ Pressure: "Just Say It Was Corrupt"

### The December 27, 2020 Phone Call

Trump called Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue to pressure them to support his election fraud claims.

### The Key Quote

When Rosen told Trump the DOJ couldn't alter election results, according to Donoghue's contemporaneous handwritten notes, Trump responded:
> "Just say that the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen."

### The Jeffrey Clark Scheme

Trump planned to install Jeffrey Clark, an environmental lawyer at DOJ, as acting attorney general. Clark had drafted a letter to Georgia officials alleging election fraud.

White House Counsel Pat Cipollone called Clark's draft letter a **"murder-suicide pact."**

[Source: [NPR](https://www.npr.org/live-updates/jan-6-committee-hearing-trump-justice-department)]

### Mass Resignation Threat

On January 3, 2021, a dramatic Oval Office meeting occurred where:
- Acting AG Rosen, Acting Deputy AG Donoghue, and Assistant AG Steven Engel threatened to resign
- They said **hundreds of others would resign** if Clark was installed
- Trump backed down from the Clark appointment

## The Alternate Electors Scheme

### Overview

After losing the election, Trump, his associates, and Republican Party officials in **seven battleground states** created fraudulent electoral certificates.

### The Seven States

1. Arizona
2. Georgia
3. Michigan
4. Nevada
5. New Mexico
6. Pennsylvania
7. Wisconsin

**Total fake electors**: 84 people signed false electoral certificates claiming Trump won states he lost. [Source: [CREW](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/the-cases-against-fake-electors-and-where-they-stand/)]

### Coordination

- Trump campaign officials, led by **Rudy Giuliani**, oversaw the fake electors effort
- Giuliani coordinated the process on a state-by-state level
- The fake certificates were signed on **December 14, 2020** - the same day legitimate electors voted

[Source: [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/trump-campaign-officials-rudy-giuliani-fake-electors/index.html)]

### Purpose

The intent was to pass illegitimate certificates to Vice President Pence in hopes he would count fake ballots instead of authentic certificates, thereby overturning Biden's victory. [Source: [Wikipedia - Fake Electors Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot)]

### Differences Between States

- **Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin**: Certificates falsely stated electors were "duly elected and qualified"
- **New Mexico, Pennsylvania**: Certificates included caveats, stating submission was contingent on being "later recognized" as legitimate

[Source: [Just Security Timeline](https://www.justsecurity.org/81939/timeline-false-electors/)]

### Criminal Prosecutions

Charges were filed in multiple states including Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and Wisconsin. [Source: [Arizona Mirror](https://azmirror.com/2023/08/03/how-the-fake-electors-in-seven-states-are-central-to-the-trump-jan-6-indictment/)]

## The Eastman Memo and Legal Strategy

### The Memo Author

**John Eastman**: American law professor retained by Trump, who advanced the fringe legal theory that the Vice President has unilateral authority to reject certified state electors.

### The Two-Page Memo (December 23, 2020)

Eastman outlined ways to ensure "President Trump is re-elected" by having Pence refuse to count electoral votes from seven states. Under this scheme:
- Trump would have 232 electoral votes
- Biden would have 222 electoral votes
- Trump would be declared winner

[Source: [Wikipedia - Eastman Memos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastman_memos)]

### The Six-Page Memo (January 3, 2021)

A more detailed memo imagining several scenarios for January 6th, only some leading to Trump's victory.

### Eastman's Acknowledgment of Illegality

Pence aide Greg Jacob recalled asking Eastman:
> "John, if the Vice President did what you were asking him to do, we would lose nine to nothing in the Supreme Court, wouldn't we?"

Eastman "initially said maybe we'd only lose seven to two, but ultimately acknowledged that, no, we would lose nine to nothing."

Eastman acknowledged the plan violated the Electoral Count Act but argued (incorrectly) that the Act was unconstitutional. [Source: [TIME](https://time.com/6188491/john-eastman-jan-6-testimony-trump/)]

### Federal Judge's Finding

A federal judge in California found that Trump **"more likely than not" illegally tried to obstruct Congress** on January 6, ordering Eastman to turn over emails to the January 6 Committee. [Source: [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-january-6-john-eastman-judge-emails-committee/)]

### Criminal Referral

The January 6 Committee issued a criminal referral for Eastman to the Department of Justice. [Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/19/trump-lawyer-john-eastman-referred-for-prosecution-by-jan-6-committee-.html)]

# Part II: January 6, 2021 - The Insurrection

## The Rally Speech - "Save America"

### Setting

**Time**: Noon, January 6, 2021
**Location**: The Ellipse, near the White House
**Duration**: Over one hour

### Key Inciting Quotes

**On the election:**
> "We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved."

**On marching to the Capitol:**
> "Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we're going to walk down and I'll be there with you."

> "We're going to walk down -- we're going to walk down. Anyone you want, but I think right here, we're going to walk down to the Capitol -- and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women."

> "So we are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue â I love Pennsylvania Avenue â and we are going to the Capitol."

**"Fight Like Hell":**

### Word Count Analysis

- Trump used variations of the word **"fight" 20 times**
- He said **"peacefully" only once**
- The January 6 Committee found the words "peacefully and patriotically" were drafted by speechwriters, not Trump
- Trump personally ad-libbed "fight" on approximately 18 occasions

### Giuliani's "Trial by Combat"

Before Trump spoke, Rudy Giuliani told the crowd:
> "Over the next 10 days, we get to see the machines that are crooked, the ballots that are fraudulent, and if we're wrong, we will be made fools of. But if we're right, a lot of them will go to jail. **Let's have trial by combat.**"

Giuliani later claimed it was a "Game of Thrones" reference. [Source: [Rev Transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcripts/rudy-giuliani-speech-transcript-at-trumps-washington-d-c-rally-wants-trial-by-combat)]

At 2:24 PM, with the Capitol under siege, Trump posted:

## Vice President Pence's Role and Danger

### Pence's Refusal of Eastman Plan

Pence rebuffed the plan to reject state electoral votes, arguing he did not have constitutional authority to carry it out.

### The Threat

- Rioters erected a **makeshift gallows** outside the Capitol
- Chanted **"Hang Mike Pence"**
- A confidential informant told the FBI that Proud Boys "would have killed Pence at the Capitol if they were able"
- Rioters came **within 40 feet** of Pence

### Evacuation

- 2:13 PM: Secret Service agent removed Pence from Senate chamber
- 2:25 PM: Full evacuation begins (one minute after Trump's attack tweet)
- Pence and family whisked to a loading dock under the Capitol
- Pence **refused to leave the Capitol entirely**

### "I'm Not Getting in the Car"

When Secret Service tried to put Pence in a vehicle to leave:
> "I'm not getting in the car, Tim. I trust you, Tim, but you're not driving the car. If I get in that vehicle, you guys are taking off. I'm not getting in the car."

Pence said he did not want the world "to see the vice president of the United States fleeing the United States Capitol." He was determined to complete certification that day.

## Trump's 187 Minutes of Inaction

### What Trump Did

**1:10 PM - 4:17 PM**: The period from when Trump finished his speech to when he finally told rioters to go home.

Trump walked from the Oval Office into the Presidential Dining Room and sat down:
> "...with the television remote and a Diet Coke close at hand. For the rest of the afternoonâas his country faced an hours-long attackâhe hunkered down in or around the dining room, watching television."

His channel of choice: **Fox News**

### What Trump Refused to Do

According to testimony from White House officials, Trump:
- **Did not call** the Secretary of Defense
- **Did not call** the Attorney General
- **Did not call** the Secretary of Homeland Security
- **Did not order** deployment of the National Guard
- **Did not order** any federal law enforcement to assist

### Resistance to Appeals for Action

**White House Counsel Pat Cipollone** told Chief of Staff Mark Meadows:
> "Mark we need to do something more. They're literally calling for the vice president to be effing hung."

**Meadows responded**, according to Cassidy Hutchinson:
> "You heard him Pat, he thinks Mike deserves it, he doesn't think they're doing anything wrong."

### "So What?"

When an aide informed Trump that Pence had been moved for his safety, Trump reportedly responded: **"So what?"**

### Leader McCarthy's Call

House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy called Trump:
> "You have got to get on TV, you've got to get on Twitter, you've got to call these people off."

Trump claimed: "These aren't my people, you know, these areâthese are Antifa."

McCarthy responded:
> "They literally just came through my office windows, and my staff are running for cover... they're running for their lives. You need to call them off."

### Resisting Calls for Peace

On at least one occasionâas his TV showed violence and injuries to policeâTrump resisted "any sort of mention of peace."

### The Committee's Conclusion

> "President Trump did not fail to act during the 187 minutes between leaving the Ellipse stage and issuing the video statement. Instead, President Trump **chose not to act**."

Representative Adam Kinzinger: "The president didn't do very much but **gleefully watch television** during this time frame."

## Military Response Delays

### The Delay

- **1:30 PM onwards**: Capitol Police, D.C. Metropolitan Police, and city officials requested National Guard support **at least 12 times**
- **4:32 PM**: Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller finally authorized Guard deployment
- **5:20 PM**: National Guard arrived - **more than 4 hours after the breach**

### Reasons for Delay

**"Optics" Concerns**: Transcripts revealed senior Pentagon officials delayed the D.C. National Guard due to concerns about how it would look.
> "A military presence could make the situation worse and that the optics were bad."

**Restrictions on Guard Authority**: On January 5, Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy issued a memo limiting D.C. National Guard authority.

Major General William J. Walker explained:
> "All military commanders normally have immediate response authority to protect property, life, and in my case, federal functions â federal property and life. But in this instance, I did not have that authority."

## McConnell's Post-Acquittal Speech

### The Contradiction

Minutes after voting to acquit, McConnell delivered a blistering speech condemning Trump.

### Key Quotes

On Trump's responsibility:
> "There is no questionânoneâthat President Trump is **practically and morally responsible** for provoking the events of that day."

On the rioters' beliefs:
> "The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president, and having that belief was a **foreseeable consequence** of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet Earth."

On Trump watching TV during the attack:
> "He did not do his job. He didn't take steps so federal law could be faithfully executed and order restored. No. Instead, according to public reports, he **watched television happily â happily â as the chaos unfolded**. Even after it was clear to any reasonable observer that Vice President Pence was in serious danger."

### Rationale for Acquittal

McConnell argued he believed it was unconstitutional to convict a president who was no longer in office.

### Pointing to Criminal Justice

McConnell noted that former presidents remain subject to prosecution:
> "We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former Presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one."

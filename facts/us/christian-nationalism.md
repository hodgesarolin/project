## Historical Development

### The True Origin Story: Segregation, Not Abortion

**Key Finding:** The religious right did not mobilize around abortion. It mobilized around defending segregation.

The religious right, who called themselves the "moral majority," actually organized around fighting to protect Christian schools from being desegregated. It was not *Roe v. Wade* (1973) that "woke the sleeping dragon of the evangelical vote." It was *Green v. Kennedy* (1970), a decision stripping tax-exempt status from "segregation academies" - private Christian schools established in response to *Brown v. Board of Education* where the practice of barring Black students continued.

**Scale of Segregation Academies:**
- By the late 1970s, an estimated **3,500 segregation academies** had been established across the South
- These schools educated approximately **750,000 white children**
- A 1972 report by the National Council of Churches, the NAACP, and others found that "one could usually identify a segregation academy by the use of the word 'Christian' or 'church' in its name"

> [!quote] Paul Weyrich on the Origins
> "What galvanized the Christian community was not abortion, school prayer, or the [Equal Rights Amendment]."
> - Paul Weyrich, conservative operative and co-founder of the Moral Majority

**The IRS Timeline:**
- Until 1970: IRS granted tax-exempt status to all private institutions regardless of racial admissions policies
- July 1970: IRS announced it could no longer justify extending tax exemptions to racially discriminatory private colleges
- November 1970: IRS notified Bob Jones University of the pending challenge to its tax exemption
- 1971: IRS issued Revenue Ruling 71-447 requiring charitable institutions to adopt nondiscrimination policies
- January 1976: IRS officially revoked Bob Jones University's tax-exempt status (retroactive to December 1, 1970)

**Bob Jones University's Discriminatory Policies:**
- Completely excluded Black applicants until 1971
- From 1971-1975: Admitted Black students only if married
- After 1975: Admitted unmarried Black applicants but denied admission to those "engaged in an interracial marriage or known to advocate interracial marriage or dating"
- Imposed disciplinary rules prohibiting interracial dating

**Political Mobilization Strategy:**
Conservative operative Paul Weyrich used the IRS enforcement as a wedge issue, reframing it as "government intrusion" and "attacks on religious freedom" - effectively diverting attention from the racial aspect. Weyrich and other leaders blamed Democratic president Jimmy Carter for the IRS actions, even though:
- The policy was mandated by Nixon
- Bob Jones University lost its tax exemption more than a year before Carter took office

**Supreme Court Decision (1983):**
In *Bob Jones University v. United States* (461 U.S. 574), the Supreme Court held 8-1 that:
- The religion clauses of the First Amendment did not prohibit the IRS from revoking tax-exempt status
- The government's purpose of eliminating discrimination in education was so fundamental that it overrode Bob Jones University's religious convictions

### Jerry Falwell and the Moral Majority (1979)

**Founding:**
- Founded in June 1979 by Baptist minister Jerry Falwell Sr. and associates

- **Tim LaHaye** - Leader of a clergy group opposed to gay rights and John Birch Society figure, served as organizer
- **Paul Weyrich** - Conservative operative who provided strategic direction

**Mission and Context:**
The Moral Majority formed in response to social and cultural transformations of the 1960s and 1970s. Christian fundamentalists were alarmed by:
- The civil rights movement
- The women's movement
- The gay rights movement
- Permissive sexual morality among young people
- The teaching of evolution

> [!quote] Falwell's Declaration
> "We want to be prolife, profamily, promoral, and pro-American."
> - Jerry Falwell, 1979

**Political Impact:**
- Played a key role in mobilizing conservative Christians as a political force
- Crucial role in Republican presidential victories throughout the 1980s
- Contributed significantly to Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 and 1984

## Key Theology and Belief Systems

### Dominionism and the Seven Mountains Mandate

**Definition:**
The Seven Mountain Mandate (also known as 7M, 7MM, or Seven Mountains Dominionism) is a dominionist conservative Christian ideology within evangelical Christianity, particularly independent Charismatic groups.

**Core Concept:**
The mandate calls on Christians to gain influence, or "take dominion," over seven key areas of culture:
1. **Religion**
2. **Family**
3. **Education**
4. **Government**
5. **Media**
6. **Business**
7. **Arts and Entertainment**

**Origins:**
- 1975: Originally proposed by evangelical leader **Bill Bright** (founder of Campus Crusade for Christ, now "Cru")
- Bright partnered with **Loren Cunningham** (founder of Youth With A Mission)
- Initially framed as a framework for evangelism, not cultural takeover
- Popularized by theologian **Francis Schaeffer**, who linked it to a critique of secularism

**Evolution into Political Dominionism:**
- Since 1996: **Bill Johnson** (Bethel Church) and **Johnny Enlow** (self-described prophet) reshaped it into a more aggressive, political, and spiritually militant approach
- 2013: Wallnau and Bill Johnson's *Invading Babylon: The 7 Mountain Mandate* brought the movement to prominence
- The spiritual militancy reflects an aggressive, us-vs.-them mindset that blurs the line between faith and authoritarianism

**Connection to New Apostolic Reformation (NAR):**
- Most Seven Mountain Mandate leaders are found within the NAR movement
- Holds "revelation status" in the NAR
- NAR teaches that prophets and apostles are essential to church governance
- Apostles and prophets can receive new revelation from God to give to followers

**Growing Influence - Survey Data:**
- January 2024: **41% of American Christians** agreed with the mandate (55% of evangelicals)
- March 2023: Only 30% agreed
- This represents dramatic growth in just under a year
- Approximately **3 million people** in the U.S. attend churches that openly follow NAR leaders

**Political Connections:**
The movement was generally supportive of Trump's presidency.

> [!quote] Charlie Kirk at CPAC 2020
> "Finally we have a president that understands the seven mountains of cultural influence."

**Prominent Supporters:**
| Christian Leaders | Politicians |
|------------------|-------------|
| David Barton | Michele Bachmann |
| James Dobson | Sam Brownback |
| John Hagee | Ted Cruz |
| Bill Johnson | Newt Gingrich |
| Lance Wallnau | Mike Huckabee |
| Paula White | Charlie Kirk |
| | Sarah Palin |
| | Rick Perry |

**Criticism:**
Critics from mainstream Christian groups view the philosophy as:
- Cult-like and harmful
- Antithetical to the teachings of Jesus Christ
- Opposed to true Christian beliefs

> [!note] Critics' Question
> If Jesus' intention was to take dominion of the seven mountains, then why did He choose tax collectors, prostitutes, and fishermen as His early witnesses?

### Christian Reconstructionism and R.J. Rushdoony

**Founder:**
Rousas John Rushdoony (1916-2001) was an American Calvinist philosopher, historian, and theologian. He is credited as the father of Christian Reconstructionism and an inspiration for the modern Christian homeschool movement.

**Key Concept - Theonomy:**
"Theonomy" literally means "the law of God." Reconstructionists advocate for:
- Restoration of certain biblical laws said to have continued applicability
- Application of Old Testament law to modern society
- The death penalty not only for murder, but also for idolatry, homosexuality, adultery, witchcraft, and blasphemy

> [!quote] Definition
> A theonomic reconstructionist may be defined as "someone who believes that none of the non-ceremonial law of the Old Testament is set aside in the New and that all people, rulers and ruled alike, are under obligation to follow such law personally, and to enact it where appropriate in legislation."

**Foundational Works:**
1. **Rushdoony** - *The Institutes of Biblical Law* (1973): Argued Old Testament law should be applied to modern society, advocated reinstatement of Mosaic penal sanctions including stoning
2. **Gary North** - *An Introduction to Christian Economics* (1973): Libertarian-themed economic theory
3. **Greg L. Bahnsen** - *Theonomy in Christian Ethics* (1977): Most theologically rigorous defense of Rushdoony's concept

**Core Beliefs:**
The "bedrock" focuses on three concepts:
1. Christian dominion
2. Biblical law
3. Postmillennial eschatology

Implementation of biblical law will reconstruct society, leading to the Second Coming of Jesus.

**Major Figures:**
- **R.J. Rushdoony** - Father of the movement
- **Greg L. Bahnsen** - Best-known exegetical proponent
- **Gary North** - Most prolific author

**Infrastructure:**
Rushdoony founded the **Chalcedon Foundation** in Los Angeles in 1965, which promoted Christian Reconstructionism.

**Influence and Legacy:**
- Expert testimony in legal cases during the 1980s bolstered the homeschooling movement
- Obtained support from major Christian book publishers
- Received endorsements from Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and Frank Schaeffer (who later repudiated the movement)

---

### Spiritual Warfare Theology

**Definition:**
Spiritual warfare is the Christian concept of fighting against the work of preternatural evil forces, based on belief in evil spirits or demons that intervene in human affairs.

**Territorial Spirits:**
A concept accepted within the Charismatic movement, Pentecostalism, and Dominionist Kingdom Now theology:
- National angels or demons rule over certain geographical areas
- Demons don't only attack people but also take control of places and institutions
- Targeted institutions include journalism, academia, and municipal/federal bureaucracies
- By controlling these, demons are framed as advancing social projects opposing God's plans

**Popularization:**
- Frank E. Peretti's novel *This Present Darkness*
- Ministry of **C. Peter Wagner** and the New Apostolic Reformation
- Wagner's Spiritual Warfare Network of the 1980s and 1990s profoundly impacted broader evangelical belief

**Three Steps of Spiritual Warfare (per sociologists Christerson and Flory):**
1. Research
2. Prophecy
3. Intercession

**Wagner's Three Kinds of Strategic Spiritual Warfare:**
1. Prayer walking in groups through demon-controlled areas
2. Large prayer marches to an area where a rally is held
3. Strategic-level spiritual warfare

**Political Application:**
The ReAwaken America Tour transformed from COVID-19 protest to "a rolling Chautauqua-style celebration of the spiritual side of Trumpism," featuring NAR speakers.

> [!quote] Examples of Political Spiritual Warfare
> - 2022: Pastor Mark Burns spoke of "demonic territory that's over the land"
> - Roger Stone mentioned a "Satanic portal [appearing] above the White House" after Biden took office, stating it "must be closed. And it will be closed by prayer."

**January 6 Connection:**
- Radicalized NAR adherents believe entire cities and institutions are possessed by demonic territorial spirits
- In weeks before January 6, NAR apostles like Dutch Sheets told followers they needed to be at the Capitol to ensure Trump remained president
- Sheets met with Trump administration officials at the White House days before the attack
- **Four of the six protest permits that day were issued to NAR-affiliated charismatic church groups**

---

### Prosperity Gospel

**Definition:**
A religious belief among some Protestant Christians that:
- Financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God
- Faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase material wealth

**Key Figures:**
- **Kenneth Copeland** - One of the most prominent prosperity gospel preachers
- **Paula White** - Gained political prominence as Trump's spiritual adviser, served as chair of the evangelical advisory board, delivered the invocation at Trump's 2017 inauguration

**Political Implications:**
- Creates theological justification for wealth accumulation
- Links worldly success to divine favor
- Provides framework where political power = spiritual blessing
- Critics view it as distortion of biblical teachings

---

### End Times Theology and Israel Policy

**Dispensationalism:**
A theological framework popular among American evangelicals that:
- Interprets biblical prophecy literally
- Divides history into distinct periods or "dispensations"
- Places emphasis on Israel's role in end-times prophecy

**Key Beliefs:**
- Establishment of modern Israel (1948) fulfilled biblical prophecy
- Jewish people must control the Holy Land for Christ's return
- Predictions include rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem
- End-times events described in Revelation and Daniel

**Christians United for Israel (CUFI):**
- Founded in 2006 by pastor **John Hagee**
- **Over 11 million members** - largest Zionist organization in the world (larger than AIPAC's 5 million)
- Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas
- Founded on premise that supporting modern Israel is a biblical mandate

> [!quote] Hagee's Claim
> CUFI's most significant achievement was bringing together millions to support Israel, asserting that CUFI had awakened a "sleeping giant" of Christian Zionism.

**Theological Foundation:**
- CUFI believes God will bless those who bless the Jews and curse those who curse the Jews
- Modern Israel has central role in bringing about the second coming of Jesus Christ
- Some commentators note dispensationalists appear to welcome the prospect of war between Israel and Iran, since this would herald the predicted final confrontation

**Political Impact:**
- Involved in opening of U.S. embassy in Jerusalem (2018)
- Supported U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over Golan Heights
- 2024: Role in advancing the 21st Century Peace Through Strength Act (emergency military aid to Israel)

**Criticism:**
Many Jews remain skeptical of evangelical support due to:
- Israel's role in Christian eschatology (end times scenarios)
- Accusations of evangelical antisemitism inherent in those beliefs
- Declining support among young evangelicals

**Historical Context:**
- Mike Pence as congressman (2007): First to sponsor legislation defunding Planned Parenthood
- Pence declared: "I long for the day when Roe v. Wade is sent to the ash heap of history"

**Post-Dobbs Strategy (2022-present):**
Following the Supreme Court's *Dobbs* decision overturning Roe v. Wade (made possible by three Trump appointees), states have enacted various restrictions:
- Trigger laws activated after Dobbs
- Six-week bans ("heartbeat bills")
- Near-total bans with limited exceptions
- Personhood amendments

**Ongoing Goals:**
- Federal abortion ban
- Constitutional amendments defining personhood from conception
- Restricting medication abortion
- Limiting travel for abortion services

---

### LGBTQ+ Opposition

**Legal Strategy through ADF, Liberty Counsel, and others:**
- Supporting bans on gender-affirming care for minors
- Defending businesses that refuse to serve same-sex couples
- Challenging anti-discrimination ordinances
- Fighting bathroom bills

**Legislative Goals:**
- First Amendment Defense Act (FADA) repeatedly introduced
- State-level "religious freedom" bills
- Parental rights bills targeting LGBTQ content in schools

**First Amendment Defense Act (FADA):**
Introduced in 2015 by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rep. RaÃºl Labrador (R-Idaho), the bill would prevent federal action against those who believe:
- Marriage is or should be one man and one woman
- Sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage

**Criticized Potential Harms:**
- Federal contractors could discriminate against married gay employees citing religious belief
- Emergency shelters receiving VAWA funds could turn away same-sex couples
- Hospitals could refuse to allow same-sex spouse visitation

---

### Public School Prayer and Curriculum

**Current Battlegrounds:**

**Oklahoma:**
- State Superintendent Ryan Walters ordered schools (grades 5-12) to incorporate the Bible into lesson plans
- Purchased 500 Bibles; requested $3 million for copies for every classroom
- Parents filed lawsuit in October challenging the mandate

**Texas:**
- Bible-based curriculum for public elementary schools approved (8-7 Republican vote)
- $60 per student incentive for districts adopting the lessons

**Louisiana:**
- New law requiring public schools to display Ten Commandments
- Blocked by federal judge pending litigation
- 16 states considering similar bills

**Federal Level:**
- Trump pledged to protect prayer in public schools
- January 29: Executive orders signaling intention to divert public money to religious schools
- Proposed imposing Christian Nationalism-infused curriculum

**Legal Context:**
*Abington School District v. Schempp* (1963): Supreme Court ruled mandated Bible reading or prayer in public school curriculum is unconstitutional.

**Other Initiatives:**
- Banning books
- Mandating posting of "In God We Trust"
- "Trigger laws" to reinstate government-led prayer if Supreme Court overturns precedent

---

### "Religious Liberty" as Discrimination Shield

**Strategy:**
Using "religious liberty" arguments to create legal exceptions allowing discrimination against LGBTQ people, women seeking reproductive healthcare, and others.

**Key Cases Won:**
- *Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado* (2018)
- *303 Creative v. Elenis* (2023)
- *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby* (2014)

**Broader Application:**
- Healthcare workers refusing to provide certain services
- Businesses refusing service to certain customers
- Adoption agencies excluding same-sex couples
- Hospitals and universities claiming religious exemptions

---

### Israel Policy (Theological Motivations)

**Christian Zionist Influence:**
- CUFI's 11+ million members advocate for unconditional U.S. support for Israel
- Theological belief that supporting Israel is biblical mandate
- End times theology requires Jewish control of Holy Land

**Policy Outcomes:**
- Moving U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem (2018)
- Recognition of Israeli sovereignty over Golan Heights
- Consistent opposition to Palestinian statehood
- Military aid packages to Israel

---

## Trump and Christian Nationalism

### Capturing Evangelical Support

**2016 Election:**
- **81%** of white evangelicals voted for Trump (Pew Research)
- Exit polls: Trump led Clinton among white evangelicals **79% to 16%**
- White evangelicals composed **46%** of Trump's coalition
- About one-fourth of all voters self-identified as white evangelical Christians

**2020 Election:**
- **76-81%** of white evangelical voters supported Trump
- Trump's overall vote share among white evangelical voters increased from **77% in 2016 to 84% in 2020**
- 60% were consistent Trump supporters (voted for him in both elections)
- Additional 18% were "Trump converts"

**Motivating Issues:**
When asked what mattered most:
- Only **10%** said "Supreme Court nominees"
- Only **4%** said "abortion"
- Nearly **half** said economy or national security

> [!note] Analysis
> Rather than character, the economy was the issue that mattered most to evangelicals in both 2016 and 2020.

---

### Court Appointments as Transaction

**The Deal:**
Trump, who hadn't made organized religion a centerpiece of his life, committed to appointing conservative justices in exchange for evangelical support.

**Three Trump Supreme Court Appointments:**
1. **Neil Gorsuch** - Confirmed April 7, 2017 (54-45)
2. **Brett Kavanaugh** - Confirmed October 6, 2018 (50-48)
3. **Amy Coney Barrett** - Confirmed October 26, 2020

**Impact on Evangelical Support:**
Following Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death and Barrett's nomination in September 2020, evangelical support for Trump jumped from mid-50% range to **71%** (PRRI).

**Delivery on Promises:**
- *Dobbs v. Jackson* (2022): Overturned Roe v. Wade
- Multiple religious liberty decisions
- Trump's lower court appointments vote favorably for Christian plaintiffs at higher rates

**Characteristics of Trump Appointees:**
- Stronger or more numerous religious affiliations
- Higher rates of affiliation with Federalist Society and NRA
- More frequently vote in favor of Christian plaintiffs
- Less frequently vote in favor of Muslim plaintiffs in free-exercise cases

### January 6 Religious Imagery

**Overview:**
A report from the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty and the Freedom From Religion Foundation concluded that Christian nationalism was used to "bolster, justify and intensify the January 6 attack on the Capitol."

**Religious Symbols Present:**
- Crosses and "Jesus Saves" signs
- "Jesus 2020" flags mimicking Trump flag design
- "An Appeal to Heaven" flags (also displayed outside Speaker Johnson's office)
- "Proud American Christian" banners
- Large wooden crosses carried by demonstrators

**The Jericho March:**
Organized in weeks before January 6:
- Demonstrators marched around state capitols and the U.S. Capitol
- Blew shofars (Jewish ritual horns)
- Reenacted the biblical siege of Jericho
- Prayed for God to defeat "dark and corrupt" forces that allegedly stole the election from "God's anointed president"
- Some traveled on buses paid for by Pennsylvania state senator Doug Mastriano
- January 5: Group processed around U.S. Capitol singing "How Great Is Our God"

**Religious Framing:**
> [!quote] From Documentation
> "Christian symbols were pervasive throughout the rally. People took pride in Christian identity and often conflated Jesus and President Trump as figures of national salvation, 'Chosen Ones.'"

**NAR Connection:**
- Self-proclaimed NAR apostles told followers they needed to be at the Capitol
- Dutch Sheets met with Trump administration officials days before the attack
- **Four of six protest permits were issued to NAR-affiliated charismatic church groups**

**Documentation:**
"Uncivil Religion: January 6, 2021" - Online resource created by the University of Alabama's Department of Religious Studies and Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, documenting religious components of the insurrection.

### Christian Nationalist Rhetoric 2024-2025

**CPAC 2024:**
- Religious-right leaders characterized political struggles as "a spiritual fight"
- Jack Posobiec: "Welcome to the end of democracy - we're here to overthrow it completely. We didn't get all the way there on January 6th, but we will endeavor to get rid of it."

**Project 2025:**
Described as "the Christian Nationalist manifesto" - a playbook for restructuring the federal government along conservative Christian lines.

**Speaker Johnson:**
- Displays "Appeal to Heaven" flag (Christian nationalist symbol)
- States that God has "ordained and allowed" current political moment
- Crafted legal brief signed by 100+ House Republicans to overturn 2020 election

---

## International Connections

### Hungary as Model Christian Nationalist State

**Viktor Orban's Transformation:**
- Was an atheist when he started politics in the late 1980s
- Now calls himself a defender of Christianity
- 2011: Rewrote Hungary's constitution (Fundamental Law) to explicitly reference Christian tradition
- 2014: Spoke of building "an illiberal state, a non-liberal state"

**Key Policies:**
- Fierce anti-immigration stance
- Pro-family policies (low-interest loans, baby-expectancy loans, zero income tax for women with 3+ children)
- Rejection of "gender ideology"

> [!quote] Orban
> "We want Hungarian children. Migration for us is surrender."

**Appeal to American Conservatives:**

> [!quote] Rod Dreher, American Conservative Writer
> "I have been saying for the past year that US conservatives should come to Hungary to learn from Orban and Fidesz. Orban is not a small-government Anglo-Saxon conservative. He believes in using the power of the state to strengthen families... But the most important thing US conservatives can learn is how to use political power to fight the culture war."

**CPAC in Budapest (May 2022):**
- First CPAC held in Europe
- Views Orban's nationalism as a model to follow

> [!quote] Orban at CPAC Hungary 2022
> Christian nationalists in Europe and US must unite to win elections.

**Criticism:**
- "Fundamentally incompatible" with traditional Christian democracy because it "sells nationalism"
- Described as "a dangerous model for how religion can be used to fuel democratic backsliding"
- Christianity has become a tool for creating legitimacy and defining regime image

---

### Russia and Christian Nationalism Links

**World Congress of Families (WCF):**
- International organization promoting conservative positions on family issues
- Opposes abortion and LGBTQ+ rights
- Has held events in Russia
- Noted for connections between American conservative religious groups and Russian officials/activists
- Russian politicians promote "traditional values" as counter to Western liberal democracy

**Shared Ideology:**
- Anti-LGBTQ positions
- "Traditional family values"
- Opposition to secularism
- Critique of Western liberalism

---

### Global Religious Right Networks

**Transnational Connections:**
CPAC has become a hub for connecting the radical right globally:
- **Europe:** Hungary (2022), with French National Rally participation (until 2025 controversy)
- **South America:** Brazil (annual since 2019), Argentina (Javier Milei)
- **Central America:** El Salvador (Nayib Bukele)
- **Asia-Pacific:** Japan, South Korea, Australia

**Shared Project:**
Uniting Christian nationalist movements across borders to:
- Share strategies
- Provide mutual legitimacy
- Coordinate messaging
- Build international coalition against "globalism" and liberalism

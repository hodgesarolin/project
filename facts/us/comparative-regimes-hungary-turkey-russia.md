# Democratic Backsliding Models: Hungary, Turkey, Russia

## Research Overview

This document examines three major models of democratic backsliding in the 21st century: Hungary under Viktor Orban, Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Russia under Vladimir Putin. These cases represent the "autocratic legal playbook" - using ostensibly legal means to dismantle democratic institutions while maintaining a democratic facade.

## The 2010 Supermajority and Constitutional Rewrite

### The Electoral Victory

In 2010, Viktor Orban's Fidesz party achieved a constitutional supermajority with a disproportionate result:
- **Popular vote:** 53% (first round)
- **Parliamentary seats:** 68% (263 of 386 seats)

This supermajority gave Fidesz the power to unilaterally amend or replace Hungary's constitution without opposition input.

> "Although Fidesz won only 53 percent of the popular vote, this was enough to give it a 68 percent majority in parliament." - [Journal of Democracy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hungarys-illiberal-turn-disabling-the-constitution/)

### Constitutional Rewrite (2011)

Within a year, Fidesz:
- Passed over **200 laws**
- Drafted and adopted an entirely **new constitution**
- Subsequently passed nearly **2,000 constitutional amendments**

Key constitutional changes:
1. **Reduced Constitutional Court powers** - Limited ability to review budgetary and tax matters
2. **Changed judicial appointment process** - Government gained control over appointments
3. **Entrenched Fidesz loyalists** - Long-term positions with veto power over future governments
4. **Electoral system overhaul** - Reduced seats, gerrymandered districts

> "The new constitutional order permits the governing party to lodge its loyalists in crucial long-term positions with veto power over what future governments might do." - [Journal of Democracy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/hungarys-illiberal-turn-disabling-the-constitution/)

## Media Capture Strategy (Step by Step)

Hungary represents a "classic case of media capture" through a systematic, multi-year strategy.

### Step 1: Regulatory Capture (2010)

The first move after winning the election was new media legislation:
- Created a politicized media authority controlled by Fidesz appointees
- Gave government control over streaming rights, broadcast frequencies, and advertising
- Enabled excessive fines for newsrooms (later modified, but core control mechanisms remained)

> "From this point on, all media matters were politicized; the government decided on streaming rights, on the allocation of regional broadcast radio frequencies, state financed advertisements, or the regulations on commercial television channels." - [444.hu](https://444.hu/tldr/2022/02/28/the-art-of-media-war-this-is-how-viktor-orban-captured-the-free-press-in-hungary)

### Step 2: State Advertising as a Weapon

Between 2010-2014:
- Almost **half of all public communication contracts** went to a single applicant or were awarded without competition
- More than **half of all state advertising** ended up at Fidesz-allied media
- Independent outlets were starved of revenue

### Step 3: Using Oligarchs as Media Buyers

Key oligarchs, enriched through state contracts and favorable loans, purchased media outlets:

**Lorints Meszaros** (childhood friend of Orban):
- Rose from near-bankruptcy to one of Hungary's richest people
- Became the main media magnate
- His explanation: "God, luck, and Viktor Orban"

> "According to press watchdog Reporters Without Borders, OrbÃ¡n has used media buyouts by government-connected 'oligarchs' to build 'a true media empire subject to his party's orders.'" - [Heinrich Boll Foundation](https://www.boell.de/en/2017/08/22/hostile-takeover-how-orban-subjugating-media-hungary)

### Step 4: Closing Independent Outlets

**Nepszabadsag (2016):** Hungary's oldest daily newspaper was abruptly shuttered after being bought by Orban-allied investors.

**Index.hu:** After withdrawing state advertising and pressuring commercial advertisers, government allies infiltrated the ownership structure and fired the editor-in-chief, causing the editorial team to break up.

### Step 5: KESMA - The Media Conglomerate (2018)

In December 2018, the endgame:
- Nearly **500 pro-government outlets** simultaneously donated to a single foundation
- Headed by Orban loyalists
- Declared a matter of "strategic national importance" to evade antitrust investigation
- Now encompasses over **400 media entities**

> "The bundling of pro-government media under one roof removed the risk of 'runaway oligarchs', and facilitates a coordinated system of censorship and content control." - [International Press Institute](https://ipi.media/the-rise-of-kesma-how-orbans-allies-bought-up-hungarys-media/)

**Current state:** Orban's party controls approximately **80% of Hungary's media market resources**.

---

## Judiciary Packing

### Constitutional Court Capture

1. **Expanded the court** - Changed from 11 to 15 judges
2. **Changed appointment rules** - Required only simple majority (which Fidesz controlled)
3. **Limited jurisdiction** - Restricted ability to review budgetary matters after court ruled against economic policies
4. **Packed with loyalists** - Fidesz appointed allies to new and vacated seats

### Lowering Judicial Retirement Age

In 2011-2012, Hungary lowered mandatory retirement age from **70 to 62**:
- Forced approximately **274 experienced judges** into early retirement
- Allowed government to appoint replacements
- European Court of Justice later ruled this **discriminatory**

> "Fidesz ousted senior judges and let the government name new ones, so lowering the required retirement age for judges." - [Netherlands Helsinki Committee](https://www.nhc.nl/systematic-backsliding-of-the-rule-of-law-in-hungary-rule-by-law/)

---

## Election System Manipulation

### Structural Changes

1. **Reduced parliament size:** From 386 to 199 seats
2. **Increased single-member district weight:** From 46% to 53% of MPs
3. **Eliminated runoff elections:** Allowed plurality wins instead of majority
4. **Non-transparent redistricting:** Gerrymandering without professional consultation

### Gerrymandering Impact

Academic analysis shows:
- Large districts placed in left-opposition strongholds
- Smaller districts in Fidesz country
- If Fidesz and opposition won equal votes, **Fidesz would come out 10 seats ahead**
- Had 2006 election been run with new districts, **Fidesz would have won the election it lost**

> "By the 2022 election, 25 of the 106 districts exceeded the ODIHR standard that election districts vary in size by no more than 10 percent." - [Journal of Democracy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/how-viktor-orban-wins/)

### Diaspora Voting ("Voter Tourism")

- Extended citizenship and voting rights to ethnic Hungarians who **never lived in Hungary**
- Postal ballots from Serbia, Ukraine, Romania open to manipulation
- In 2018, **Fidesz won 96%** of diaspora votes
- Over **150,000 votes** available to insert into close districts

> "The case of Hungary shows how autocrats can rig elections legally, using legislative majorities to change the law and neutralize the opposition at every turn." - [Project Syndicate](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/hungary-orban-reelection-manipulated-election-by-balint-magyar-and-balint-madlovics-2022-04)

**Current reality:** Opposition needs to win by **5-6 percentage points** to gain a parliamentary majority.

## NGO and Civil Society Attacks ("Stop Soros")

### 2017 NGO Transparency Law

Required NGOs receiving more than **24,000 EUR annually from foreign sources** to:
- Register as "foreign-funded organizations"
- Display this label on all publications
- Created stigmatization and administrative burden

### 2018 "Stop Soros" Legislative Package

Named after Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros:
- **Criminalized** assistance to undocumented migrants
- Imposed **25% tax** on NGOs supporting migration
- Made it an offense to help asylum seekers in ways deemed "promoting illegal immigration"

> "The EU's highest court ruled against Hungary on several of these measures, finding they violated EU law on the free movement of capital and fundamental rights."

---

## University Attacks (CEU Expulsion)

### Lex CEU (2017)

The "Lex CEU" required foreign universities to:
- Have a campus in their home country
- Specifically targeted Central European University (founded by George Soros)

### Outcome

- Despite protests and international criticism, CEU forced to relocate to **Vienna, Austria**
- European Court of Justice ruled in 2020 that Hungary's law **violated EU law**
- Seen as major blow to academic freedom

> "The move was seen as a significant blow to academic freedom in Hungary."

---

## LGBTQ+ Targeting

### The 2021 Anti-LGBTQ Law

**Act LXXIX of 2021** prohibits sharing LGBTQ-related information with minors in:
- Advertising
- Media
- Schools
- Bookshops
- Family interactions

> "The law has been described as appearing to conflate [and equate] homosexuality and paedophilia, and is modelled partly on a Russian law that banned so-called 'gay propaganda' among minors. The Hungarian law goes further." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_anti-LGBTQ_law)

**Vote:** Passed 157-1 (opposition boycotted)

### 2022 Referendum

Questions asked included:
- "Do you support the teaching of sexual orientation to minors... without parental consent?"
- "Do you support the promotion of sex reassignment therapy for underage children?"

**Result:**
- Only 3.5 million of 8 million eligible voters participated
- **1.5 million votes (20%) were deliberately spoiled** in protest
- Referendum **invalidated** for failing 50% participation threshold
- **Law remains in force**

> "16 Member States joined the case in support of the Commission... effectively making this the largest human rights case in the history of the EU." - [European Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Hungarian_LGBTQ_in_education_referendum)

---

## The "Illiberal Democracy" Concept

### The 2014 Balvanyos Speech

On July 26, 2014, Orban delivered his landmark speech at Baile Tusnad, Romania:

> "A democracy is not necessarily liberal. Just because something is not liberal, it still can be a democracy." - Viktor Orban

**Key points from the speech:**
1. Liberal states will not sustain world-competitiveness
2. Hungary has abandoned liberal principles
3. Inspired by "international stars" such as **China, Singapore, Turkey, and Russia**
4. Liberalism promotes selfish interests of unpatriotic individuals
5. Only illiberal democracy can serve the nation's general interest

### Later Clarifications (2019)

> "The essence of illiberal democracy is Christian liberty and the protection of Christian liberty... the politics that works for Christian liberty works to protect all that the liberals despise."

> "Christian democracy is not liberal. Liberal democracy is liberal, while Christian democracy is, by definition, not liberal: it is, if you like, illiberal."

## EU Tensions and Funding

### Article 7 Procedure

- Launched by European Parliament in **2018** against Hungary
- Assesses "clear risk of serious breach" of EU values
- **Stuck for seven years** - no recommendation issued by Council
- Blocked by unanimity requirement (Hungary and Poland mutually protect each other)

### Financial Sanctions

The EU froze billions in funds:
- **22 billion EUR** in cohesion funds
- **5.8 billion EUR** in Recovery and Resilience Facility funds
- **6.3 billion EUR** suspended under rule of law conditionality mechanism

Disbursement tied to **17 milestones** on:
- Combating corruption
- Public procurement transparency
- Judicial independence

### Current Status (2025)

- Parliament criticized release of **10.2 billion EUR** despite unfulfilled reforms
- **18 billion EUR** remains frozen
- Hungary faces ongoing hearings on rule of law crisis

> "Despite the continued systematic and well-documented breakdown in the rule of law in Hungary, the EU Council has for seven years repeatedly failed to take any concrete steps under article 7." - [Transparency International](https://transparency.eu/why-the-eu-must-trigger-the-article-72-teu-procedure-against-hungary/)

## Why Orban is CPAC Favorite

### CPAC Hungary (2022-2025)

Budapest has hosted CPAC for **four consecutive years**, marking unprecedented alliance between American conservatives and European far-right.

### Orban's Appeals to American Conservatives

**2024 CPAC Speech:**
> "Make America great again, make Europe great again! Go Donald Trump! Go European sovereigntists! Let us saddle up, don our armor, take to the battlefield."

**2022 CPAC Speech:**
> "The woke movement and gender ideology are exactly what Communism and Marxism used to be... they artificially cut the nation into minorities in order to spark strife among the groups."

### American Conservative Praise

- **Kari Lake:** Meeting Orban "changed my life"
- **Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD):** "Hungary has become one of the most successful models as a leader for conservative principles and governance"
- **Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ):** "Hungary's immigration policy should serve as a model to the United States"

### Why the Alliance?

Shared positions on:
- Immigration restrictions and border walls
- Opposition to "gender ideology"
- Skepticism of EU/globalism
- Emphasis on Christian/national identity
- Media criticism ("liberal media")

> "Many American conservatives have in recent years viewed Hungary - and OrbÃ¡n - as an aspirational playbook for governance in the United States." - [CNN Politics](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/politics/gop-conservatives-hungary-cpac-orban-invs/index.html)

- Promised combination of **democratic principles and Islamic values**
- Pursued **EU accession requirements**
- Expanded civic freedoms
- Reduced military influence in politics
- Launched "democratic opening" to address Kurdish problem

> "There were times, particularly in the first, pragmatic phase of AKP rule, which lasted roughly until 2010, when hopes for a truly democratic order were stronger." - [MERIP](https://www.merip.org/2018/12/turkeys-constitutional-coup/)

- Erosion of judicial independence

---

## 2013 Gezi Park Protests and Crackdown

### What Happened

### Government Response

The government's **harsh crackdown** on protesters marked a turning point:
- Police violence against peaceful demonstrators
- Mass arrests
- Media censorship of coverage

> "It was the government's response to the Gezi Park protests in 2013 and the subsequent assaults on rights that gravely undermined the party's credentials and self-representation as a vehicle of 'civilianisation, democratisation, freedom of belief and equality of opportunity.'" - [Democratic Erosion](https://democratic-erosion.org/2025/04/19/arresting-opposition-and-squashing-protests-democratic-backsliding-in-turkey-under-erdogan/)

- **Multiple journalists arrested** at their homes
- BBC correspondent **Mark Lowen deported** for covering protests

> "The cumulative effect of these changes transformed a once-promising democracy into an authoritarian system with a democratic facade. The fact that each step was typically undertaken through legal mechanisms allowed the government to maintain a veneer of legitimacy." - [Democratic Erosion](https://democratic-erosion.org/2025/04/19/arresting-opposition-and-squashing-protests-democratic-backsliding-in-turkey-under-erdogan/)

## 1999-2000 Rise to Power

### The Path to Power

On December 31, 1999, Boris Yeltsin resigned and named Vladimir Putin as his successor.

**Putin's background:**
- Former KGB officer
- Director of Federal Security Service (FSB)
- Appointed Prime Minister in August 1999

### Oligarch Support

Putin's rise was fueled by Russia's oligarchs:
- **Vladimir Gusinsky** and **Boris Berezovsky** deployed their television stations and newspapers
- Transformed Putin from unknown figure to household name
- Support increased from **2% in August 1999 to 51% by end of year**

> "A relatively unknown 'apparatchik' saw his support increase from only 2% in August 1999 to 51% by the end of the year. This growth was the result of active support in the media and from the oligarchic elite." - [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/03/29/1088886554/how-putin-conquered-russias-oligarchy)

---

## Oligarch Management

### The July 2000 Meeting

In summer 2000, **21 of the richest men in Russia** entered the Kremlin for a historic meeting with newly elected President Putin.

### The Unwritten Deal

Putin's message:
- **Stay out of politics** = keep your fortunes
- **Challenge the Kremlin** = face consequences

> "Putin's main task was curbing the power of the oligarchs. In 2000, he made them an unwritten deal, asserting that if they stayed out of politics, they could maintain their fortunes." - [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/03/29/1088886554/how-putin-conquered-russias-oligarchy)

### Those Who Refused

**Vladimir Gusinsky:**
- Owner of NTV (critical of Putin)
- Arrested in 2000

## Media Takeover (NTV, etc.)

### NTV - Russia's First Independent TV

**Background:**
- Founded in 1993 by oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky
- Russia's first private television station
- Produced critical news broadcasts and political satire
- Famous for "Kukly" (Puppets) - satirical show mocking Kremlin

> "Founded in 1993 by oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky, NTV quickly became the talk of the entire country, producing must-see daily news broadcasts like 'Segodnya' (Today), political satire programs like 'Kukly' (Puppets), and weekend news magazine shows like 'Itogi' (Summary)." - [Radio Free Europe](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia_independent_ntv_fell_silent/3557594.html)

### The Takeover (2000-2001)

When NTV began criticizing and satirizing Putin:
1. **Armed agents in camouflage and ski masks** raided NTV's offices
2. Government alleged Gusinsky stole $10 million in privatization deal
3. Gusinsky **jailed, then released** on condition of selling NTV
4. **Gazprom** (state-controlled energy company) completed hostile takeover

### Consequences

> "After the takeover of NTV, a very serious degradation of society took place... By turning off the light and sound in the country, the Russian authorities could then proceed with the course of destroying free enterprise, liquidating elections, and so on." - Igor Yakovenko

- Results not published due to "political considerations"

> "According to Brookings, there is no doubt that the Kremlin is responsible for Navalny's death, stating that Putin's goal is to eliminate all opposition to his rule." - [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-death-of-alexei-navalny/)

### Other Eliminated Opposition Figures

After Navalny's death:
> "There is no opposition leader left in Russia. Putin ran for re-election in March 2024, and the Kremlin eliminated any opposition figures from the ballot... The remaining opposition leaders are either in prison or in exile." - [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/navalny-dead-putin-critics-kremlin-russia-opposition-exile-rcna139169)

## Ukraine War and Domestic Repression (2022-Present)

### War Censorship Laws (March 2022)

Immediately after invasion:
- Banned criticizing Russia's aggression in Ukraine
- Criminalized calling invasion a "war" (must say "special military operation")
- Maximum sentence: **15 years in prison**
- Up to **3 years** for calling for sanctions

> "This law effectively criminalizes any public opposition to or independent news reporting about the war and could make it a crime to simply call the war a 'war' on social media or in a news article." - [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/russia-kremlin-censors-media-and-disperses-protesters-opposed-to-ukraine-invasion/)

### Mass Detentions

- **14,906 people detained** from Feb 24 - March 13, 2022
- Reports of **police brutality during arrests**
- Reports of **torture under detention**

### Three Years of Repression (2022-2025)

- **61% favor immediate ceasefire**

> "The third year of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues to be marked by ongoing political repression within the country. Despite a decline in large-scale anti-war protest, tight censorship and pressure on civil society remains unrelenting." - [OVD-Info](https://ovd.info/en/antiwar_3_years)

2. **Legal:** "Foreign agent" laws, treason charges
3. **Economic:** Advertising pressure, funding cuts
4. **Physical:** Arrests, exile, assassination
5. **Digital:** Internet restrictions, social media controls

# PART IV: COMMON PLAYBOOK ELEMENTS

## The Autocratic Legal Playbook

> "What we have learned from studying democratic backsliding and autocratization over the last 20 to 25 years is that this new wave of autocrats have figured out how to effectively consolidate power using law. They call it 'rule by law,' not by force. The basic strategy in the 'autocratic legal playbook' is to use ostensibly legal means to make legal changes that are designed to target key democratic institutions that are supposed to check executive power." - [Harvard Law School](https://clp.law.harvard.edu/article/why-american-lawyers-must-fight-democratic-backsliding/)

## Legal Methods to Destroy Democracy

### Key Characteristics

1. **Led by democratically elected leaders**
2. **Incremental rather than revolutionary**
3. **Difficult to pinpoint exact moment democracy ends**
4. **Maintains veneer of legitimacy**
5. **Uses courts and legislatures, not military**

> "Backsliding is often led by democratically elected leaders, who use 'incremental rather than revolutionary' tactics. As emphasized by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, it is difficult to pinpoint a single specific moment at which a government is no longer democratic." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding)

### Two Pathways

**Fast Track:**
- Identify/create emergency
- Invoke extraconstitutional authority
- Suspend normal framework
- Example: Bolsonaro's 2022 fraud claims (failed)
- Example: Erdogan post-2016 coup

**Slow Road:**
- Incremental legal changes over time
- Weakens institutions gradually
- Often disguised as routine adjustments
- Example: Orban's decade-long capture
- Example: Putin's oligarch management

## Judiciary as First Target

### Why Judiciary First?

The judiciary is targeted early because it:
- Can strike down unconstitutional laws
- Can prosecute corruption
- Provides avenue for opposition challenges
- Must be neutralized before other captures

### Common Methods

| Method | Hungary | Turkey | Russia |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Retirement age changes | Yes | Yes | - |
| Court packing | Yes | Yes | - |
| Jurisdiction limits | Yes | Yes | - |
| Mass purges | - | Yes (36%) | - |
| Appointment control | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Prosecutorial control | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Media Capture Sequence

### Typical Pattern

1. **Regulatory capture** - Control licensing, advertising allocation
2. **Economic pressure** - Withdraw state advertising from critics
3. **Oligarch purchases** - Allies buy independent outlets
4. **Closure of holdouts** - Shut remaining independents
5. **Consolidation** - Create single pro-government media empire

### Results by Country

| Country | Government Media Control |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Hungary | ~80% |
| Turkey | ~90% |
| Russia | ~100% |

## Civil Society Attacks

### Target Categories

1. **NGOs** - Foreign funding restrictions, "agent" labels
2. **Universities** - Closures, purges, funding cuts
3. **Religious minorities** - Discrimination, bans
4. **LGBTQ+ community** - "Propaganda" laws, criminalization
5. **Ethnic minorities** - Political exclusion, prosecution

### Methods

- Legal registration requirements
- "Foreign agent" designations
- Tax investigations
- Funding restrictions
- Criminal charges against leaders
- Physical intimidation

## Emergency Powers

### Pattern

1. **Crisis occurs** (real or manufactured)
2. **Emergency declared**
3. **Normal checks suspended**
4. **Purges conducted under emergency**
5. **Emergency powers made permanent**

### Examples

| Country | Trigger | Result |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Turkey | 2016 coup | 2 years emergency; permanent presidential powers |
| Russia | War | War censorship laws; 15-year sentences |
| Hungary | COVID, migration | Various decree powers |

## Constitutional Manipulation

### Common Changes

1. **Term limit resets** (Russia 2020)
2. **Presidential system transitions** (Turkey 2017)
3. **Court packing provisions** (Hungary)
4. **Emergency power grants** (All three)
5. **Electoral rule changes** (Hungary)

### Process

- Use legislative supermajority to amend
- Or use referendum under state of emergency
- Or use emergency decrees to bypass legislature
- Lock in changes to bind future governments

## Scapegoat Groups

### By Country

**Hungary:**
- George Soros / NGOs
- Migrants / refugees
- LGBTQ+ community
- Brussels / EU bureaucrats
- "Liberal" media

**Turkey:**
- Gulenists
- Kurdish politicians / PKK
- Journalists as "terrorists"
- Academics as "traitors"
- Western interference

**Russia:**
- Oligarchs (initially)
- Chechens / terrorists
- "Foreign agents"
- LGBT "propaganda"
- Ukraine / NATO / West

# PART V: US COMPARISON AND PARALLELS

## What US Has Already Adopted

### According to Scholars

In 2025, political scientists conducted surveys finding:
> "Hundreds of scholars say U.S. is swiftly heading toward authoritarianism." - [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5340753/trump-democracy-authoritarianism-competive-survey-political-scientist)

### The Competitive Authoritarian Framework

> "When scholars discuss 'authoritarianism' in this context, they aren't referring to systems like China's one-party state with no meaningful elections. Instead, they are referring to something called 'competitive authoritarianism,' the kind scholars say they see in countries such as Hungary and Turkey." - [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/01/nx-s1-5340754/trump-authoritarianism-u-s-hungary-turkey-orban-erdogan-duterte-maria-ressa)

## Tactics Already Implemented

### 1. Purging Civil Servants

> "Following the blueprint created by authoritarian governments in Hungary, Poland, Turkey, and Venezuela, the Trump administration removed professional civil servants from the Justice Department, the FBI, and other key government agencies and put loyalists in charge." - [Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/american-authoritarianism-levitsky-way-ziblatt)

**Comparison:**
> "After Orban became prime minister in 2010, his government stripped public employees of key civil service protections, fired thousands, and replaced them with loyal members of the ruling Fidesz party."

### 2. Attacks on Universities

> "Trump and his administration have launched relentless attacks on America's higher education system. These moves are reminiscent of actions in other countries experiencing democratic backsliding such as Hungary, Russia, Turkey, and India." - [Global Project Against Hate and Extremism](https://globalextremism.org/post/trumps-attacks-on-american-universities/)

**Methods:**
- Launching investigations into dozens of universities
- Illegally freezing billions in research funding
- Pressing for removal of university leaders

### 3. Media Intimidation

> "Like elected autocrats in El Salvador, Hungary, India, Turkey, and Venezuela, Trump has bullied independent media. He has sued The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, and the Federal Communications Commission has opened investigations into a range of establishment media outlets, including ABC, CBS, PBS, NPR, and Comcast." - [Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/american-authoritarianism-levitsky-way-ziblatt)

### 4. Business Sector Co-optation

> "For aspiring autocrats, policy and regulatory decisions can serve as powerful carrots and sticks to attract business support. This kind of patrimonial logic helped autocrats in Hungary, Russia, and Turkey secure private-sector cooperation." - [Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/american-authoritarianism-levitsky-way-ziblatt)

## Speed Comparison

> "Steps comparable to the series of measures that Trump took in his early days to consolidate control over the executive workforce took form over a year-long period in Hungary. Trump has had a matter of months." - [Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/path-american-authoritarianism-trump)

> "In Trump's second term, the United States has descended into competitive authoritarianism... Not only did the United States follow a similar path under Trump in 2025, but its authoritarian turn was faster and farther-reaching than those that occurred in the first year of these other regimes." - [Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/american-authoritarianism-levitsky-way-ziblatt)

## What's Coming Next (Based on These Models)

### Predicted Next Steps

Based on Hungary/Turkey/Russia playbook:

1. **Judiciary capture intensification**
   - More judicial appointments
   - Attacks on judicial independence
   - Using courts against opponents

2. **Media consolidation**
   - Economic pressure on independent media
   - Favorable treatment for allied outlets
   - Potential FCC actions against critics

3. **Civil society targeting**
   - NGO investigations
   - "Foreign influence" accusations
   - University funding cuts

4. **Electoral manipulation**
   - Voting restrictions
   - Gerrymandering
   - Electoral commission control

5. **Emergency power expansion**
   - Using crises for power grabs
   - Normalizing executive overreach

## Key Differences

### US Institutional Strengths

> "American institutions are stronger than those in Hungary, Turkey, and other countries with competitive authoritarian regimes. An independent judiciary, federalism, bicameralism, and midterm elections - all absent in Hungary, for instance - will likely limit the scope of Trump's authoritarianism." - [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/15/trump-authoritarian-moment-national-guard-venezuela-caribbean-military/)

**Protective factors:**
- **Federalism:** State governments as counterweight
- **Independent judiciary:** Lifetime appointments, tradition of independence
- **Bicameralism:** Two chambers can check each other
- **Midterm elections:** Regular opportunities for course correction
- **Free press tradition:** Stronger independent media culture
- **Civil society strength:** Robust NGO sector

### Limitations

> "The Trump administration's desire for authoritarianism 'appears bottomless,' but its 'capacity' to achieve it is still limited. If one were to assess the United States solely in terms of how well it's doing as a constitutional democracy, then 'things are really bad.' But it is still far from the type of consolidated authoritarian system that one might encounter in a country such as Russia." - [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/15/trump-authoritarian-moment-national-guard-venezuela-caribbean-military/)

## Personal Accounts

### Those Who Fled Authoritarianism to the US

> "Pinar grew up in Turkey and says she watched Erdogan attack scholars and consolidate power over the news media. She moved to the U.S. in 2016 to study for her Ph.D. and to have intellectual freedom. 'It was about survival as an academic,' Pinar recalls, 'to be able to continue thinking, teaching, writing without fear.'" - [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/01/nx-s1-5340754/trump-authoritarianism-u-s-hungary-turkey-orban-erdogan-duterte-maria-ressa)

> "Having left Turkey's autocracy for America's freedom, Pinar says she never saw a period like this coming. 'I feel quite fragile because I feel like I can't work freely here,' she continues. 'It just feels like I'm stuck.'"

---

# Summary: The Three Models Compared

| Element | Hungary | Turkey | Russia |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Leader** | Orban (2010-) | Erdogan (2003-) | Putin (2000-) |
| **Initial path** | Electoral supermajority | Electoral victory | Appointed successor |
| **Key crisis used** | Migration (2015) | Coup attempt (2016) | Terrorism/Chechnya |
| **Constitutional change** | New constitution (2011) | Presidential referendum (2017) | Term reset (2020) |
| **Media control** | ~80% | ~90% | ~100% |
| **Opposition status** | Marginalized | Imprisoned | Eliminated |
| **Freedom House** | Partly Free | Not Free | Not Free |
| **EU status** | Member (Article 7) | Candidate (stalled) | Not applicable |
| **US relationship** | CPAC favorite | NATO ally (strained) | Adversary |

## Core Lessons

1. **Democracy can be dismantled legally** - No coup required
2. **Judiciary and media are key first targets** - Capture both early
3. **Each step seems small** - Incremental change masks total transformation
4. **Crisis is opportunity** - Real or manufactured emergencies enable power grabs
5. **Constitutional manipulation locks in changes** - Bind future governments
6. **Scapegoats mobilize support** - Out-groups justify illiberal measures
7. **International allies help** - Mutual protection (Hungary-Poland; CPAC network)

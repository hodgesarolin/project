## 1. The Reagan Revolution (1981-1989)

### Union Busting: The PATCO Strike

**Key Event**: On August 3, 1981, 13,000 members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) went on strike demanding wage increases, equipment upgrades, and a reduced workweek.

**Reagan's Response**:
- Despite PATCO having endorsed Reagan in the 1980 election, Reagan declared the strike a "peril to national safety"
- On August 5, 1981, Reagan fired 11,345 striking air traffic controllers and banned them from federal service for life
- PATCO was bankrupted and decertified; many leaders were arrested
- The civil service ban was not lifted until 1993 under Clinton; by 2006, only 850 strikers had been rehired

**Impact on Labor Movement**:
- Strike activity collapsed: from over 380 major strikes in 1970 to just 40 in 1988 (Reagan's final year)
- By 2017, there were only 7 major strikes nationally
- Private employers like Phelps Dodge (1983), Hormel (1985-86), and International Paper (1987) began hiring permanent striker replacements
- Alan Greenspan later called the PATCO firing "perhaps the most important" factor in creating U.S. labor market "flexibility"

> **Analysis**: The PATCO strike represents a watershed moment in American labor history. While some scholars note Reagan's NLRB appointments and economic policies caused broader damage, the strike "normalized the aggressive strike-breaking and union-busting agenda" that had been developing in the private sector.

### Deregulation and the Savings & Loan Crisis

**Policy Changes**:
- The Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 expanded S&L powers
- S&Ls were permitted to make riskier commercial real estate investments (up to 40% of assets)
- Thrift examinations reduced by 26% between 1981-1984
- Regulatory "forbearance" allowed insolvent "zombie" institutions to continue operating

**Results**:
- Over 1,000 savings and loan associations failed
- The Resolution Trust Corporation closed 747 S&Ls with over $407 billion in assets
- Taxpayer cost estimated at $124 billion
- 45% of losses occurred in Texas alone

> **Analysis**: While deregulation began under Carter, the Reagan administration "made it vastly worse" through reduced oversight and ideological commitment to shrinking government. The crisis demonstrated the consequences of removing financial safeguards.

### Wealth Transfer: Tax Cuts and Inequality

**Tax Policy**:
- Top marginal income tax rate slashed from 70% to 28%
- Major cuts in 1982 and 1986-1987

**Outcomes**:
- Top 1% income share rose from 9.0% in 1979 to 13.8% in 1986
- National debt nearly tripled during the 1980s
- Federal revenues were $1.3 trillion short of spending over Reagan's presidency (more than 3x the deficits of the previous eight years)
- Income inequality increased; poverty rate at end of Reagan's term same as 1980
- By 2007, top 1% saw after-tax income increase 175% since 1979 (vs. 18% for bottom 20%)
- Today, top 1% control about 32% of all wealth (up from 23% in 1989)

> **Analysis**: Studies find "a strong negative association between top marginal income tax rates and top income shares." The promise that tax cuts would "pay for themselves" proved false.

## 2. Iran-Contra Affair (1985-1987)

### The Scandal

**What Happened**:
- The Reagan administration secretly sold missiles and arms to Iran (under an arms embargo) hoping to free American hostages in Lebanon
- Oliver North, an NSC staffer, diverted proceeds from the arms sales to fund the Contras in Nicaragua
- This violated the Boland Amendment, which prohibited U.S. aid to the Contras

**Key Details**:
- Only $12 million of the $30 million paid by Iran reached government coffers
- The remaining funds were diverted to the Contras
- Attorney General Edwin Meese discovered the diversion in November 1986

### Drug Trafficking Connections

- The Contras facilitated cocaine trafficking through Central America into the U.S.
- Some Contras were themselves cocaine traffickers; others allied with drug cartels
- SETCO, a company used for Contra supply operations and funded through Oliver North's accounts, was established by Juan Matta Ballesteros, a "Class I DEA violator" and major figure in the Colombian cartel
- North's conduct featured "a pattern of deliberate deception" and "a willingness to cooperate with known drug dealers"

### The Pardons

On December 24, 1992, just 12 days before Caspar Weinberger was to go to trial, President George H.W. Bush pardoned him along with five other Iran-Contra defendants:
- Caspar Weinberger (Secretary of Defense)
- Robert McFarlane (National Security Adviser)
- Elliott Abrams (Assistant Secretary of State)
- Alan Fiers (CIA Task Force Chief)
- Clair George (CIA Deputy Director)
- Duane Clarridge (CIA Counter-Terrorism Chief)

**Cover-Up Allegations**:
- Weinberger's notes contained "evidence of a conspiracy among the highest-ranking Reagan administration officials to lie to Congress and the American public"
- Notes from a January 7, 1986 meeting showed "VP favored" regarding the arms sales
- Bush did not turn over his own campaign diary (containing "highly relevant contemporaneous notes") until December 1992
- Attorney General Bill Barr advised Bush on the pardons
- Independent Counsel Walsh wrote that Bush "had little intention of cooperating"

> **Analysis**: The pardons effectively halted legal proceedings that could have implicated Bush himself. Walsh concluded the pardons "completed the Iran-Contra cover-up."

## 3. The War on Drugs

### The Ehrlichman Admission

In a 1994 interview (published in Harper's Magazine in 2016), John Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic policy chief, stated:

> "The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did."

**Context**:
- Ehrlichman spoke "with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect"
- Ehrlichman's family disputed the account after his 1999 death
- Some historians note Nixon's drug policies also included public health measures
- Regardless of intent, the outcomes align with Ehrlichman's description

### The Crack Cocaine Disparity

**The 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act**:
- Created a 100:1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine
- 5 grams of crack = 5-year mandatory minimum
- 500 grams of powder cocaine = same 5-year sentence
- Passed amid "moral panic" following the cocaine-related deaths of athletes Len Bias and Don Rogers

**Racial Impact**:
- After the Act, Black incarceration for drug crimes rose from ~50 per 100,000 to ~250 per 100,000
- Sentencing disparity between Black and white drug offenders increased from 11% to 49%
- From 2015-2023, Black people made up 80% of crack cocaine convictions (vs. 6% white)
- "While drug use rates are similar among all racial groups," Black drug offenders are 20% more likely to receive prison sentences

**Scientific Reality**:
- The U.S. Sentencing Commission later found "the differences between the effects of the two drugs are exaggerated"
- The disparity was "based on misinformation about the pharmacology of cocaine"

**Reforms**:
- 2010 Fair Sentencing Act reduced ratio to 18:1
- 2018 First Step Act made this retroactive (3,705 people received reduced sentences; 2,000+ released)

## 4. Mass Incarceration

### The Numbers

| Year | Prison/Jail Population | Rate |
|------|----------------------|------|
| 1970 | ~360,000 | - |
| 1980 | 329,000 | - |
| 1988 | 627,000 | - |
| 2008 | 2.3 million (peak) | 1 in 100 adults |
| 2021 | ~1.9 million | - |

**Scale**:
- Since 1970, incarceration increased by 700%
- Over 5 million people total are under criminal justice supervision
- The U.S. incarcerates more people, in absolute numbers and per capita, than any other nation

**Presidential Impact**:
- Nixon declared the "war on drugs" and "tough on crime"
- Prison population doubled under Reagan (329,000 to 627,000)
- Growth continued through the 1990s, peaking in 2008

---

### Racial Disparities

**Current Statistics**:
- National Black incarceration rate is 6x the white rate
- This disparity exists in every single state
- Black Americans: 14% of population, 33% of prison population, 46% of those serving 10+ years
- 1 in 3 Black boys born today can expect imprisonment (vs. 1 in 17 white boys)
- 1 in 6 Latino boys can expect imprisonment

**Drug Enforcement Disparities**:
- 5% of illicit drug users are Black
- 29% of those arrested for drug offenses are Black
- 33% of those incarcerated for drug offenses are Black

**Historical Context**:
- Prison racial composition flipped from majority white at midcentury to majority Black by the 1990s
- "Law and order" rhetoric with racial undertones emerged in the 1960s

**Women's Incarceration**:
- 1970: fewer than 6,000 women in state/federal prison
- 2015: 105,000 (17x the 1970 level)
- 2022: ~82,000

**Recent Trends**:
- Prison populations began declining around 2009 (down 25% by 2021)
- Black prison population decreased 39% since 2002 peak
- Racial disparities have also fallen, reflecting bipartisan consensus that mass incarceration was a mistake

## 5. The Clinton Era (1993-2001)

### The 1994 Crime Bill

**Official Name**: Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994

**Key Provisions**:
- Expanded federal death penalty to dozens of new crimes
- Federal "three strikes" mandatory life sentence
- $12.5 billion for states to build prisons (if they passed "truth-in-sentencing" laws requiring 85% of sentence served)
- Billions for hiring additional police
- Violence Against Women Act
- Federal Assault Weapons Ban

**Impact**:
- By 1999, 42 states had adopted truth-in-sentencing laws
- Did not start mass incarceration but "certainly escalated the scale of its impact"
- "Exacerbated the trend" of rising incarceration
- Fell "hardest on Black and Brown communities"

> **Analysis**: The crime bill was a "political compromise" that "contributed to both the crime decline and mass incarceration." Its legacy remains "complicated" but is "now seen by many as a major driver of mass incarceration."

### Welfare "Reform" (1996)

**The Law**: Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act

**Key Changes**:
- Ended Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the 61-year-old cash assistance program
- Created time limits on federal assistance
- Required work within two years of receiving benefits
- Reduced federal spending for low-income families

**Outcomes**:
- Welfare rolls dropped from 14.2 million (1993) to 5.3 million (2002)
- Three HHS assistant secretaries resigned in protest
- Peter Edelman called it a destruction of the safety net, projecting it would "drive millions more people into poverty"

**Racial Disparities in Implementation**:
- Research found "the racial composition of the welfare population in the state is the most important predictor of state policy choices"
- States with more nonwhite welfare populations were more likely to impose stricter time limits, harsher penalties, and benefit limitations

> **Analysis**: "Welfare has been reformed, but the poverty it sought to remedy remains with us." Income inequality has grown exponentially since the law's passage.

**Sources**: [Wikipedia - PRWORA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act), [Centre for Public Impact](https://centreforpublicimpact.org/public-impact-fundamentals/the-1996-personal-responsibility-and-work-opportunity-reconciliation-act-in-the-us/), [BlackPast](https://blackpast.org/african-american-history/welfare-we-knew-it-1996-personal-responsibility-and-work-opportunity-act/)

### Financial Deregulation: Glass-Steagall Repeal

**The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (1999)**:
- Repealed key provisions of Glass-Steagall (1933), which had separated commercial and investment banking
- Allowed creation of "financial holding companies" combining banking, securities, and insurance
- Passed Senate 90-8, House 362-57
- Signed by Clinton on November 12, 1999

**Context**:
- In 1998, Citibank merged with Travelers (violating existing law), given 2-year forbearance expecting law change
- Rep. John Dingell warned the bill would create banks "too big to fail" requiring federal bailout

**Debate Over Effects**:
- Critics (Stiglitz, Warren, Kuttner) tie repeal to 2008 financial crisis
- Clinton in 2015: "There's not a single, solitary example that [the repeal] had anything to do with the financial crash"
- Some economists note failed firms (Lehman) were least diversified; survivors (JP Morgan) most diversified

> **Analysis**: Whether or not GLBA directly caused the 2008 crisis, 1999 represented "the pivotal policy-making moment" when Congress could have "reaffirm[ed] the importance of effective structural safeguards" but chose not to.

## 6. First Gulf War (1990-1991)

### The Highway of Death

**What Happened**:
- On February 26-27, 1991, U.S.-led coalition forces attacked retreating Iraqi forces on Highway 80 between Kuwait City and Basra
- U.S. planes "trapped the long convoys by disabling vehicles in the front and at the rear, and then pounded the resulting traffic jams for hours"
- One U.S. pilot said: "It was like shooting fish in a barrel"
- Attack used cluster bombs and incendiary rounds

**Destruction**:
- 1,400-2,000 vehicles destroyed or abandoned on Highway 80
- Several hundred more on Highway 8 to Basra
- Included tanks, armored vehicles, and civilian cars/trucks/buses commandeered by military

**Casualties**:
- Estimates range widely from 200-300 to upwards of 10,000
- Postwar studies found most vehicles were abandoned before being struck

**Legal/Ethical Controversy**:
- Critics argue disproportionate force against troops retreating in compliance with UN Resolution 660
- Column included Kuwaiti hostages and civilian refugees (including Palestinian families)
- Some argue attack violated Geneva Conventions Common Article III (prohibiting killing soldiers "out of combat")
- Bush administration claimed troops were "retreating to regroup and fight again"

> **Analysis**: "While some viewed the attack as a necessary act of war, others criticized it as a potential war crime." The incident "raised profound ethical questions about the conduct of war and the protection of human rights during armed conflicts."

**Sources**: [Wikipedia - Highway of Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_of_Death), [Rare Historical Photos](https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/highway-death-in-pictures-1991/), [Liberation News](https://liberationnews.org/george-h-w-bushs-complicity-in-the-1991-highway-of-death-massacre/)

### Iraq Sanctions and Child Deaths

**The Albright Exchange (1996)**:

On 60 Minutes, Lesley Stahl asked UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright:
> "We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?"

Albright responded:
> "I think this is a very hard choice, but the price - we think the price is worth it."

**The Death Toll**:
- During the 1990s-2000s, surveys found child mortality more than doubled during sanctions
- Estimates ranged from 227,000 to 500,000 excess deaths among children under 5
- The 500,000 figure came from a 1995 UN FAO preliminary report

**Albright's Regret**:
- Later called it "a terrible mistake, hasty, clumsy and wrong"
- Said she had "fallen into the trap and said something I simply did not mean"
- "I have said 5,000 times that I regret it"

**Disputed Statistics**:
- A 2017 BMJ study argues the 1990s spike in child mortality "did not actually occur" as reported
- However, sanctions "almost certainly did cause many children to die who would otherwise have lived"

**Policy Impact**:
- The controversy led the UN Security Council to largely abandon comprehensive sanctions in favor of targeted sanctions

**Sources**: [FAIR - "We Think the Price Is Worth It"](https://fair.org/extra/we-think-the-price-is-worth-it/), [Democracy Now - Albright](https://www.democracynow.org/2022/3/24/former_secretary_state_madeleine_albright_dies), [Wikipedia - Iraq Sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_against_Iraq)

## 7. NAFTA and Globalization (1994)

### The Agreement

**North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)**:
- Negotiated by U.S., Canada, and Mexico
- Entered into force January 1, 1994
- Eliminated most tariffs, focused on agriculture, textiles, and auto manufacturing

### Job Losses and Deindustrialization

**Employment Impact**:
- Estimated 700,000 U.S. jobs lost as production moved to Mexico
- Through 2002, the rising trade deficit displaced 879,280 U.S. jobs (most high-wage manufacturing)
- U.S. auto sector lost 350,000 jobs (1/3 of industry) since 1994
- Mexican auto employment grew from 120,000 to 550,000

**Wage Suppression**:
- "Threat effects": Companies told workers they would move to Mexico unless labor costs were reduced
- During union negotiations, some companies "would even start loading machinery into trucks they said were bound for Mexico"
- Contributed to "stagnant and falling wages"

**Deindustrialization**:
- "Stimulating the growth of lower paying services industries and accelerating the deindustrialization of our economy"
- "High-paying manufacturing jobs are being lost and replaced by lower paying jobs"

### Counterarguments

- Congressional Research Service (2015): "The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest"
- Many job losses "would likely have taken place even in the absence of NAFTA" due to Chinese competition
- 2014 study found net loss of ~15,000 jobs per year, but gains of ~$450,000 per job lost through productivity and lower consumer prices

> **Analysis**: NAFTA's effects are debated, but it clearly "changed the composition of employment in America" and strengthened employers' bargaining power against workers through credible relocation threats.

## 8. Rwandan Genocide (1994)

### What the U.S. Knew

**Early Warnings**:
- August 1992: Diplomatic cables cited local concerns that an extremist party was pursuing "a call for the extermination of Tutsis"
- When killing began in April 1994: "We had a very good sense of what was taking place... It was clear that a systematic killing of Tutsi was taking place"
- Senior officials privately used the term "genocide" within 16 days of the killings beginning

**U.S. Response**:
- Government documents (declassified 2004) show administration "knew that Rwanda was being engulfed by genocide in April 1994 but buried the information to justify US inaction"
- State Department instructed spokesmen not to describe deaths as genocide
- Officials told to say merely that "acts of genocide may have occurred"
- A May 26, 1994 legal memo noted: "Concluding that genocide has occurred/is occurring in Rwanda does not create a legal obligation to take particular action to stop it"

**Why Inaction?**
- Directly influenced by the 1993 Somalia intervention failure
- Defense Department "did not want to spend money"
- "Boy, oh boy, did the shooting down of the plane on April 6 and the withdrawal of the Belgians give us the excuse we needed to pull the plug"

**Death Toll**: Estimated 800,000 killed

**Clinton's Later Regret**:
- Called failure to intervene "one of his biggest regrets"
- Said intervention, "even marginally, at the beginning... at least 300,000 people might have been saved"
- Visited Rwanda in 1998 and 2005, apologized both times

> **Analysis**: Former President Clinton claimed he "never knew the extent of suffering during Rwanda's genocide. But America's diplomats on the ground knew exactly what was happening." The administration made a deliberate choice to avoid the word "genocide" to avoid pressure to act.

## 9. Yugoslavia/Kosovo (1999)

### The Intervention

**Background**:
- 1989: Direct rule from Belgrade imposed on predominantly Albanian Kosovo
- Ethnic cleansing produced flows of refugees

**NATO Action**:
- Operation Allied Force: March 24 - June 11, 1999
- 78 days of bombing using up to 1,000 aircraft
- No UN Security Council authorization (Russia and China would have vetoed)
- Stated justification: humanitarian intervention

### Legal and Ethical Questions

**Legality**:
- "Neither authorized by the United Nations Security Council nor permitted by Yugoslavia's government"
- "Legitimacy of the presumed basis... is hotly debated"

**Selective Intervention**:
- Critics note NATO chose to target Yugoslavia rather than Turkey or Indonesia for similar human rights issues
- "The selectivity of targeting the FRY rather than Turkey or Indonesia further questions NATO's moral judgement"
- NATO chose "remote bombing rather than land invasions" which "endangered civilian populations"

### Humanitarian Outcomes

**Before vs. During Intervention**:
- 2,652 people killed/disappeared before intervention
- 9,426 people killed/disappeared during Operation Allied Force
- NATO airstrikes directly killed 758 people
- 800,000 refugees fled Kosovo during the bombing
- At least 488 Yugoslav civilian deaths confirmed

> **Analysis**: "Although there was undoubtedly a humanitarian crisis, the methods chosen by NATO to solve this were highly flawed... and did not meet the criteria of proportionality by doing more harm than good."

**Outcome**:
- Yugoslav Army withdrew from Kosovo
- UN peacekeeping mission (UNMIK) established

**Sources**: [Wikipedia - NATO Bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia), [NATO - Kosovo Air Campaign](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49602.htm), [E-International Relations](https://www.e-ir.info/2013/06/21/was-natos-intervention-in-kosovo-in-1999-just/)

## 10. Neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus

### Definition

**Neoliberalism**: Market-oriented reform policies including:
- Eliminating price controls
- Deregulating capital markets
- Lowering trade barriers
- Privatization
- Reducing state influence in the economy through austerity

Associated with Reagan (U.S.) and Thatcher (U.K.)

### The Washington Consensus

**Origin**: Term coined in 1989 by economist John Williamson

**Ten Policy Prescriptions** promoted by IMF, World Bank, and U.S. Treasury for developing countries:
1. Fiscal discipline (reduce deficits)
2. Reordering public expenditure priorities
3. Tax reform
4. Liberalizing interest rates
5. Competitive exchange rates
6. Trade liberalization
7. Liberalization of inward foreign direct investment
8. Privatization
9. Deregulation
10. Property rights

### Implementation and Effects

**Structural Adjustment**:
- Developing countries had to adopt reforms to receive IMF/World Bank loans
- Latin American countries (Chile, Mexico, Argentina) were early adopters

**Mixed Results**:
- Chile maintained high growth (7.3% annually, 1990-1998)
- Argentina's 1999-2002 economic crisis held out as example of Washington Consensus failure
- Sub-Saharan Africa saw "initial declines in per capita economic growth over the 1980s and 1990s"

**Political Backlash**:
- "Shrinking middle class in Latin America prompted dissatisfaction of neoliberalism"
- Led to "a turn to the political left and populist leaders" (Chavez in Venezuela, Morales in Bolivia, Correa in Ecuador)

**Evolution**:
- By late 1990s, even proponents acknowledged limitations
- Asian Financial Crisis (1997), Argentina collapse (2001) led to reassessment
- "Post-Washington Consensus" emerged, acknowledging need for different institutions in different economies

> **Analysis**: The Washington Consensus represented the dominant economic orthodoxy of the era, shaping U.S. domestic policy and international development approaches. Its mixed results and political backlash have led to significant reassessment.

## Key Themes and Patterns

### Bipartisan Consensus

The late 20th century saw remarkable bipartisan agreement on:
- Deregulation (Carter through Clinton)
- "Tough on crime" policies (Nixon through Clinton)
- Free trade (Reagan through Clinton)
- Welfare reduction (Reagan through Clinton)

### Racial Control Through Criminal Justice

- War on Drugs explicitly designed to target Black communities (per Ehrlichman)
- Crack/powder disparity created vastly disproportionate Black incarceration
- Mass incarceration transformed prison population from majority white to majority Black
- Drug enforcement disparities persist despite similar usage rates

### Wealth Transfer

- Tax cuts primarily benefited the wealthy
- Deregulation led to crises paid for by taxpayers
- Union busting reduced worker bargaining power
- Trade agreements strengthened capital over labor

### Selective Intervention

- Rwanda: Genocide ignored (no strategic interest)
- Kosovo: Intervention without UN authorization
- Iraq: Devastating sanctions on civilians
- Pattern: Humanitarian rhetoric applied inconsistently based on strategic interests

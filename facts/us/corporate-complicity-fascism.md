## Overview

This document examines the historical and contemporary patterns of corporate collaboration with fascist and authoritarian regimes. From the industrial giants that enabled Nazi Germany to modern tech companies accommodating authoritarian governments, a consistent pattern emerges: corporations tend to prioritize profits, market access, and political favor over democratic values and human rights.

# Part I: Nazi Germany Corporate Collaboration

## IBM and the Holocaust

### The Strategic Alliance

IBM's German subsidiary, Dehomag (Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft), provided the punch card technology that enabled the Nazi regime to efficiently identify, track, and ultimately exterminate millions of Jews and other targeted groups.

**Key Facts:**
- IBM did not sell machines to Nazi Germany; they were **leased monthly**, ensuring ongoing service relationships
- Authorized IBM repairmen serviced machines on-site, including at concentration camps
- Custom-designed punch cards were required for the machines to operate - "like rifles without bullets"
- The infamous **Auschwitz tattoo began as an IBM number** - a five-digit Hollerith tracking number
- IBM's technology facilitated: census data collection, military logistics, ghetto statistics, train traffic management, and concentration camp capacity tracking

### IBM's New York Knowledge

Edwin Black's 2001 book *IBM and the Holocaust* documented that IBM New York established a special subsidiary, **Watson Business Machines**, specifically to deal with operations in Nazi-occupied Poland.

## Ford Motor Company

### Henry Ford's Personal Nazi Ties

Henry Ford was one of Hitler's most prominent American admirers, and the admiration was mutual.

**Key Facts:**
- Hitler told a Detroit News reporter in 1931: **"I regard Henry Ford as my inspiration"** and kept Ford's life-size portrait behind his desk
- Ford is the **only American mentioned favorably in Mein Kampf**
- Heinrich Himmler described Ford in 1924 as "one of our most valuable, important, and witty fighters"
- Ford owned *The Dearborn Independent*, which spread antisemitic propaganda
- Ford paid to print and distribute **500,000 copies of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion**
- In 1938, Ford received the **Grand Cross of the German Eagle**, Nazi Germany's highest honor for foreigners

### Ford Motor Company Operations

- Ford opened an auto plant in Cologne, Germany; by WWII, Ford's German interests were worth approximately **$8.5 million**
- Ford Werke (Germany) and Ford SAF (France) produced military vehicles for the Nazi war effort
- **Ford operations used forced labor**, including prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates
- When U.S. Army liberated Ford plants in Cologne and Berlin, they found "destitute foreign workers confined behind barbed wire"
- A 1945 U.S. Army report concluded: German Ford served as an **"arsenal of Nazism" with the consent of headquarters in Dearborn**

### Post-War Compensation

After WWII, Ford **received nearly $1 million in U.S. government reparations** for Allied bombing damage to its Cologne military truck complex.

## General Motors / Opel

### Pre-War Operations

- GM acquired Germany's largest automobile company, **Adam Opel A.G.**, in 1929
- GM's Opel produced **40% of vehicles in Germany** and about **65% of its exports**
- Opel became an indispensable supplier to the German armed forces, providing most of the trucks that motorized the Nazi attempt to conquer Europe

### The Opel Blitz

- Opel cooperated with the Reich in locating a new heavy truck facility at Brandenburg, which military officials advised would be **less vulnerable to Allied air attack**
- From 1935-1944, over **130,000 Opel "Blitz" trucks and chassis** were produced for the Wehrmacht
- **The Opel Blitz was used as a mobile gas van** to kill victims with carbon monoxide during the Holocaust

### Aircraft Production

- In 1939, GM converted its 432-acre Opel complex in Russelsheim to warplane production
- The Russelsheim facility assembled **50% of all propulsion systems for the JU-88 bomber**, the Luftwaffe's most important bomber
- It also assembled **10% of jet engines for the ME-262**, the world's first operational jet fighter

### Nazi Honors

In 1938, **James D. Mooney**, head of GM's overseas operations, received the **German Eagle with Cross** - the highest medal Hitler awarded to foreign commercial collaborators.

### Forced Labor

Starting in 1940, Opel used thousands of forced laborers, including POWs, civilians from occupied countries, and concentration camp prisoners.

### Post-War

- GM claimed that a "German board of managers appointed by the Nazis" assumed control after September 1939
- Beginning in 1948, GM regained control of Opel operations and assets
- GM collected approximately **$33 million in "war reparations"** for Allied bombing of its German facilities

> "General Motors was far more important to the Nazi war machine than Switzerland... The Nazis could have invaded Poland and Russia without Switzerland. They could not have done so without GM." - Researcher Bradford Snell

## Standard Oil and IG Farben

### The Cartel Formation

- In 1929, Standard Oil of New Jersey and Germany's IG Farbenindustrie formed a patents cartel
- Standard Oil paid IG Farben **$30 million for patents** on the hydrogenation process
- In 1927, Standard Oil and IG Farben founded "**Standard IG Farben**"

### Critical Technology Transfers

- Standard Oil supplied information on manufacturing **tetraethyl lead** (essential for aviation fuel) and **synthetic rubber**
- In 1938, Standard Oil and British subsidiaries supplied **500 tons of tetraethyl lead to Germany's Luftwaffe**
- The hydrogenation process for producing synthetic gasoline **enabled Germany to go to war in 1940**

An IG Farben official wrote:
> "Without tetraethyl lead, the present method of warfare would have been impossible. The fact that since the beginning of the war we could produce tetraethyl lead is entirely due to the circumstances that shortly before, the Americans presented us with the production plans, complete with their know-how."

### The Synthetic Rubber Scandal

- Standard Oil withheld synthetic rubber processes from American industry
- When Standard developed **butyl rubber**, it turned the process over to IG Farben but **refused to give it to the U.S. Navy**
- This contributed to the rubber shortage that "seriously crippled American production"

### Congressional Investigation

Senator Harry S. Truman shouted **"Treason!"** during wartime investigations. Standard Oil signed a consent decree, released 2,000 patents royalty-free, and paid a **$50,000 fine**.

- **40 French prisoners of war** also worked for the company
- Conditions were poor: "Hygiene levels and food supplies were extremely uncertain at times"

### Personal Beliefs

Historian Roman KÃ¶ster stated:
> "The fact that he was a party member in 1931 certainly didn't hurt him, but if you look at the rest of Boss' career, then it's clear that he did not join the party just out of economic calculation."

Boss kept a photograph of himself with Hitler, taken at Berghof, in his apartment until 1945.

### Post-War

- Initially classified as an "activist" and "supporter and beneficiary of National Socialism"
- Stripped of voting rights, capacity to run a business, fined 100,000 Reichsmarks

# Part II: Why Corporations Collaborated

## The Anti-Communist Appeal

Hitler explicitly used fear of communism to court business support. He argued:
- "Private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of democracy"
- "Business was founded above all on the principles of personality and individual leadership"
- "Democracy and liberalism led inevitably to Social Democracy and Communism"

**Many business leaders supported Nazis as an alternative to communism**, even if they would have preferred a more moderate conservative government.

Capitalist countries (Britain, France, Italy, Canada, Finland) had already tried to crush communism in the Soviet Union, sending troops to support the White Russians from 1918-1923.

## The Profit Motive

Corporate-fascist partnerships operated on mutual benefit:

- **Labor suppression**: Collective bargaining was abolished, wages were frozen
- **Business profits rose rapidly**, as did corporate investment
- **Government protection**: Business leaders who cooperated got government protection; those who didn't were crushed
- **Market stability**: Fascist policies stabilized markets and expanded state contracts

> "Scholars noted that big business developed an increasingly close partnership with the Italian Fascist and German Nazi governments after they took power. Business leaders supported the government's political and military goals, and in exchange, the government pursued economic policies that maximized the profits of its business allies."

## Financial Support for the Nazi Party

In 1932, the Nazi Party faced financial ruin. German industrialists bailed them out in early 1933:

- **Gustav Krupp** pledged 1 million marks at a Berlin meeting and was later awarded the title "Fuhrer of Industry"
- **IG Farben executives** gave 400,000 marks at a February meeting, and **4.5 million marks total by end of 1933**

> "This infusion of corporate cash saved the Nazi Party from financial disaster." - Brennan Center for Justice

## Opportunism Over Ideology

Research indicates German industrialists "weren't, by and large, ideologues as much as opportunists; it was their eagerness for profits that led them to participate."

> "The amoral pragmatism and professionalism that propelled Farben's executives dwell within all large-scale organizations, whether they be corporate or political, whether they seek to maximize power or profits."

# Part III: Post-War Accountability (or Lack Thereof)

## The Nuremberg Industrial Trials

Three industrial trials were held as part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials:
1. **Flick Trial**
2. **IG Farben Trial**
3. **Krupp Trial**

Charges included: using forced labor, looting property from Nazi victims, and funding SS atrocities.

### Key Limitation

> "The Nuremberg Charter introduced the concept of attributing criminality to a group or organisation. However, the trials ultimately showed a duality when it came to corporate liability... provisions did exist for criminalising organisations under Articles 9-11 of the Charter, they were never exercised to punish a corporation."

**The IMT tried individuals, not entities** - corporations themselves escaped prosecution.

### Lenient Outcomes

- American judges "were unaccustomed to seeing prominent and wealthy defendants charged with complicity in mass murder"
- Many accused were **acquitted, given light sentences, or pardoned**
- **Within a few years, all convicted war criminals were released**

The IG Farben tribunal:
- Rejected charges for preparing aggressive war despite extensive evidence
- Allowed the defense of "necessity" for slave labor charges
- Only found evidence sufficient for Auschwitz, where intent to use slave labor was undeniable

## Denazification Failures

> "The Cold War undermined the Allies' efforts at denazification, and both the Soviet Union and the United States rehabilitated large numbers of former Nazis. In West Germany, the Western Allies ended all their efforts at denazification in favor of enlisting the help of former Nazis in the fight against Communism."

### Examples of Rehabilitation

- **Alfried Krupp**: 12-year sentence commuted by U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy in 1951; property restored; became one of Europe's wealthiest men
- **Fritz ter Meer**: Directed IG Farben operations at Auschwitz; became president of Bayer after the war
- **All 13 convicted IG Farben executives**: Released from prison early by 1951

## Corporate Reparations Decades Later

### German Foundation Initiative (1999-2000)

Following pressure, major German companies created a compensation fund for forced laborers:
- Supported by: Allianz, BASF, Bayer, BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Degussa-HÃ¼ls, Dresdner Bank, Friedrich-Krupp, Krupp-Hoesch, Hoechst, Siemens, Volkswagen

### Individual Company Actions

- **Hugo Boss** (2000): Joined the compensation fund; apologized in 2011
- **Bayer** (1995): Apologized for Holocaust role
- **Deutsche Bank** (1999): Disclosed role in financing Auschwitz construction

## Legacy for Corporate Accountability

> "The body of international criminal law that has developed in the wake of Nuremberg largely excludes corporationsâto speak nothing of the individual executives that compose themâfrom scrutiny." - Legal scholar Grietje Baars

## Global AI Surveillance

### The Scale of Surveillance

At least **75 out of 176 countries** are actively using AI technologies for surveillance:
- Smart city/safe city platforms: 56 countries
- Facial recognition systems: 64 countries
- Smart policing: 52 countries

### Huawei's Role

- Huawei supplies AI surveillance technology to **at least 50 countries** worldwide
- No other company comes close (next largest non-Chinese supplier: Japan's NEC at 14 countries)
- Many safe city surveillance systems are deployed in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and Spain

### Palantir

- Supplies data integration and tracking solutions to police, government agencies, and corporations
- U.S. government contracts represent **over 42% of Palantir's Q1 2025 revenue**

- LAPD feeds social media data into Palantir platforms to create detailed protester profiles

### Democracies as Surveillance Users

> "51 percent of advanced democracies deploy AI surveillance systems. In contrast, 37 percent of closed autocratic states, 41 percent of electoral autocratic states, and 41 percent of electoral democracies deploy AI surveillance technology."

## Facebook/Meta and Authoritarianism

### The Myanmar Genocide

Facebook operated with a **de facto monopoly** in Myanmar before the 2017 genocide. For most users, "Facebook is the internet."

**Key Findings:**
- Amnesty International accused Meta of having "substantially contributed" to human rights violations against the Rohingya
- Facebook's algorithms **"proactively amplified" anti-Rohingya content**
- The Myanmar military and Buddhist extremist groups coordinated "saffron washing" campaigns on Facebook
- A UN fact-finding mission (2018) determined Facebook had been a **"useful instrument" for vilifying the Rohingya**

### Legal Actions

- In 2021, Rohingya victims sued Facebook for **$150 billion**
- In November 2024, the International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor revealed an arrest warrant application connected to violence in Myanmar

**Assessment:**
> "Facebook helped facilitate a genocide in Myanmar, and it will not be held legally accountable." - Harvard Law School, Systemic Justice Project

### Recent Concerns (2024-2025)

- Following Meta's announcement of changes to fact-checking mechanisms, Amnesty International warned this could exacerbate Facebook's contribution to hate speech
- Myanmar has **18.5 million Facebook users** (over 33% of the population)

## Twitter/X Under Elon Musk

### Increased Compliance with Authoritarian Demands

Under Musk's leadership:
- Twitter/X has approved **83% of government content removal requests** (up from ~51% under previous leadership)
- Government requests to Twitter more than doubled: from 348 to 971 in comparable periods

### Turkey

- Restrictions occurred on the eve of Turkey's 2023 national election
- Under previous ownership, Twitter actively resisted Turkish demands and was banned for two weeks in 2014
- In 2025, X suspended accounts of opposition figures during protests over the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu
- **Musk has personal business interests in Turkey**: Erdogan is pursuing deals for Tesla factory, xAI, and Starlink

### India

- In July 2022, Twitter sued the Indian government over censorship orders
- After Musk's takeover, Twitter **complied with more than 100 block orders**, including against journalists, foreign politicians, and poet Rupi Kaur
- Blocked access to the BBC's documentary on Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat massacre
- During 2024 Farmers' protests, X withheld 177 social media accounts at government request

### Accusations of Hypocrisy

> "You can't crown yourself the grand poobah of free speech while also cravenly caving to the demands of foreign autocracies where you also, conveniently and completely coincidentally, happen to have other business interests."

> "Previously, Twitter had policy staffers who worked hard to figure out when government demands were legitimate and when they were overblown. But Musk fired most of the people doing this work shortly after taking the helm."

# Part V: US 2025 Context

## Corporate DEI Rollbacks

### The Political Driver

Trump's executive orders targeted DEI programs, labeling them "illegal and immoral discrimination programs." Many corporations cite the 2023 Supreme Court affirmative action decision as legal justification for changes.

### Major Companies Rolling Back DEI

**Amazon:**
- Declared it would roll back "outdated programs and materials" related to DEI
- Shifting to "performance-driven diversity" rather than numerical hiring goals

**McDonald's:**
- Ceasing set representation goals
- Pausing external surveys
- Retiring supply chain DEI pledge
- Renaming diversity team to "global inclusion team"

**Target:**
- Concluding three-year DEI goals
- Stopping external diversity-focused surveys
- Evolving supplier diversity to "supplier engagement"

**Google:**
- Scrapping DEI hiring goals
- 2020 target of 30% leadership from underrepresented groups abandoned

- Stopping use of term "Latinx"
- Stopping participation in Human Rights Campaign surveys
- Re-evaluating supplier diversity programs

**Other companies cutting DEI:** Tractor Supply, Harley Davidson, Brown-Forman (Jack Daniel's), Ford, Molson Coors, Lowe's

### Companies Standing Firm

> "We got into diversity efforts because we felt it was the right thing for the National Football League, and we're going to continue to do those efforts. We're not in this because it's a trend to get into it or a trend to get out of it." - NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell

# Part VI: Patterns and Lessons

## Why Corporations Accommodate Authoritarians

### Historical Pattern: The February 1933 Model

At a secret meeting in Berlin on February 20, 1933, over twenty German industrialists made large donations to the Nazi Party's upcoming election campaign.

> "In the very short run, their bets paid off, and firms supporting the Nazi movement experienced unusually high financial returns. But in so doing, they became complicit in the catastrophe that resulted." - Brennan Center for Justice

### The Core Motivations

1. **Profit Maximization**
   - Access to lucrative markets
   - Government contracts
   - Protection from competition

2. **Labor Suppression**
   - Abolition of collective bargaining
   - Wage controls
   - Strike prevention

3. **Anti-Communism**
   - Fear of socialist alternatives
   - Protection of private property
   - Ideological alignment

4. **Risk Avoidance**
   - Fear of expropriation
   - Avoiding regulatory punishment
   - "Going along to get along"

5. **Short-Term Thinking**
   - Quarterly earnings pressure
   - Executive compensation tied to stock price
   - Assumption someone else will handle the politics

### The Mutual Benefits Structure

> "Unlike socialism, the state doesn't own industries outright, but private ownership is only allowed if it serves state interests. The government sets production goals and enforces them through a rigid hierarchy. Business leaders who cooperate get government protectionâthose who don't get crushed."

---

## What Makes Corporations Resist

### Factors That Enable Resistance

1. **Consumer Pressure**
   - Boycott threats
   - Brand reputation concerns
   - Customer base alignment with democratic values

2. **Employee Activism**
   - Worker organizing
   - Talent retention concerns
   - Internal pressure campaigns

3. **Investor Activism**
   - ESG concerns
   - Shareholder resolutions
   - Divestment campaigns

4. **Geographic Diversification**
   - Less dependence on single authoritarian market
   - Alternative revenue sources

5. **Leadership Values**
   - Individual executives willing to take risks
   - Corporate culture that prioritizes principles

### Examples of Resistance

- **Over 1,000 companies** curtailed Russian operations beyond legal requirements
- **Nike, Lyft, eBay**: Maintained pledges not to fund election deniers
- **Google**: Withdrew from China in 2010 over censorship; abandoned Project Dragonfly
- **NFL**: Maintaining DEI commitments despite political pressure

---

## The Accountability Gap

### Structural Barriers to Accountability

1. **Legal Framework**
   - Nuremberg established that individuals, not corporations, face criminal liability
   - International criminal law largely excludes corporations from scrutiny
   - Limited extraterritorial jurisdiction

2. **Political Will**
   - Cold War amnesty for Nazi collaborators set a precedent
   - Geopolitical considerations override accountability
   - Lobbying power of corporations

3. **Time Delays**
   - Apologies and settlements come decades later
   - Responsible individuals often die before accountability
   - Corporate leadership turns over

4. **Scale of Complicity**
   - When collaboration is widespread, accountability becomes politically impossible
   - "Too big to prosecute" syndrome

## Lessons for Today

### From Nazi Germany to Today: Continuities

| Historical Pattern | Modern Manifestation |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| IBM punch cards tracking Jews | Palantir tracking immigrants, protesters |
| Ford/GM producing military vehicles | Tech companies enabling surveillance |
| Standard Oil technology transfers | Apple/Google enabling censorship |
| Deutsche Bank financing genocide | Corporate donations to anti-democratic politicians |
| Hugo Boss using forced labor | Companies using exploited labor in authoritarian states |
| Companies demanding reparations for bombed factories | Companies seeking compensation while continuing harmful practices |

### Key Warning Signs

1. **Corporations prioritizing market access over human rights**
2. **Corporate donations to politicians undermining democratic institutions**
3. **Companies complying with authoritarian censorship demands**
4. **Technology being deployed for surveillance and control**
5. **Corporate retreats from diversity and inclusion under political pressure**
6. **Business leaders cultivating personal relationships with authoritarian figures**
7. **Short-term profit calculations overriding long-term ethical considerations**

### The Ultimate Lesson

> "History proves that if businesses collude with autocrats, this can hasten democracies' decline and collapse."

The German industrialists of 1933 believed they could manage the National Socialists. They were wrong. Today's corporate leaders face similar choices - and similar self-deceptions.

**The pattern is clear:** Corporations accommodate authoritarians when it serves short-term interests, resist when pressure from consumers, employees, and investors makes accommodation too costly, and rarely face meaningful accountability for complicity.

**The responsibility falls to civil society** - consumers, workers, investors, and citizens - to make the cost of collaboration with authoritarianism higher than the cost of resistance.

## Overview

This document examines the first half of the 20th century in US history, focusing on the nation's transformation from a continental power to a global empire through two world wars, economic crises, and the establishment of international institutions. Particular attention is given to perspectives often omitted from standard US education: the economic motivations behind war, the suppression of domestic dissent, racial violence and exclusion, and the foundations of American global hegemony.

## 1. World War I Entry (1917)

### Official Justifications vs. Economic Realities

**Fact:** The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, after President Woodrow Wilson requested a declaration of war from Congress on April 2, 1917.

### The Zimmermann Telegram

**Fact:** The Zimmermann telegram was a secret diplomatic communication issued from the German Foreign Office on January 17, 1917, proposing a military alliance between Germany and Mexico if the United States entered WWI. Germany promised that with its aid, Mexico would recover Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico.

**Fact:** The telegram was intercepted by British intelligence and revealed to the American public. German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann publicly admitted the telegram was genuine on March 3, 1917.

### War Profits and Financial Interests

**Fact:** J.P. Morgan & Co. acted as purchasing agent for the Allies, facilitating the purchase of over $3 billion worth of war material. The firm underwrote $1.5 billion in war loans to London and earned over $200 million in profits from an 8.3% commission on Entente borrowing.

**Source:** [Doughboy Foundation - J.P. Morgan's Efforts to Push the U.S. Into WWI](https://doughboy.org/j-p-morgans-efforts-to-push-the-u-s-into-wwi/)

**Fact:** Du Pont, which manufactured smokeless gunpowder, doubled its price in 1915 and saw annual profits increase from $5 million to $82 million. U.S. Steel's net earnings jumped from 5.2% in 1915 to 24.9% in 1917.

**Fact:** Major General Smedley Butler wrote in "War Is a Racket" that some companies increased their profits by up to 1,700% during WWI, and that at least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made during the war.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - War Profiteering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_profiteering)

**Fact:** By 1917, Britain and France had exhausted their credit lines. The Wilson administration faced a choice: guarantee repayment of Allied loans or cease war material shipments. Wilson's pledge of repayment guaranteed that Morgan and other bankers would be reimbursed in case the Allies defaulted.

### The Nye Committee Investigations (1930s)

**Fact:** The Senate committee headed by Senator Gerald Nye investigated the influence of financial interests on the US decision to enter WWI. The committee examined testimony from representatives of J.P. Morgan, DuPont (which produced gunpowder), and Bethlehem Steel (which made armor).

**Fact:** The "Merchants of Death" theory accused arms dealers of working behind the scenes to encourage war. The Nye Committee hearings led Congress to pass the Neutrality Laws from 1935 to 1939.

### Propaganda: The Committee on Public Information

**Fact:** President Wilson established the Committee on Public Information (CPI) through Executive Order 2594 on April 13, 1917. It was the first large-scale propaganda agency of the U.S. government.

**Fact:** The CPI was chaired by journalist George Creel, who recruited approximately 75,000 "Four Minute Men" volunteers to give pro-war speeches at social events. The agency issued nearly all government announcements and sent out 6,000 press releases.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Committee on Public Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Public_Information)

**Fact:** The CPI's propaganda included vicious anti-German imagery, featuring offensive stereotypes of "The Hun" as a brutal monster. One poster depicted a German gorilla with a club labeled "kultur"; another showed a "green-eyed, blue-skinned German soldier with bloody fingers."

**Fact:** A 1940 Council on Foreign Relations report credited the CPI with creating "the most efficient engine of war propaganda which the world had ever seen."

**Source:** [First Amendment Encyclopedia - Committee on Public Information](https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/committee-on-public-information/)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** The standard narrative presents US entry into WWI as a response to German aggression (submarine warfare, Zimmermann telegram). However, the economic evidence suggests significant financial interests were at stakeâAmerican banks and corporations had invested heavily in Allied victory. The subsequent Nye Committee investigation and Neutrality Acts demonstrate that contemporaries recognized these economic motivations. The CPI's propaganda campaign also reveals how public opinion was manufactured rather than organic.

## 2. Red Scare #1 (1919-1920)

### The Palmer Raids

**Fact:** The Palmer Raids were a series of raids conducted in November 1919 and January 1920 by the Department of Justice under Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to capture and arrest suspected socialists, anarchists, and communists for deportation.

**Fact:** On August 1, 1919, Palmer appointed 24-year-old J. Edgar Hoover to head the new General Intelligence Division (GID) with responsibility for investigating radical groups.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Palmer Raids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Raids)

**Fact:** On November 7, 1919 (the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution), federal and local authorities raided the Union of Russian Workers in New York City and arrested more than 200 individuals.

**Fact:** On December 21, 1919, 249 radicals including anarchist Emma Goldman were deported to Russia aboard the USS Buford, dubbed the "Soviet Ark" by the press.

**Fact:** On January 2, 1920, the largest Palmer Raids occurred, with between 3,000 and 10,000 individuals arrested in more than 30 cities. In total, 6,000 people were arrested across 36 cities.

**Source:** [HISTORY - Palmer Raids](https://www.history.com/articles/palmer-raids)

**Source:** [Immigration History - The Palmer Raids](https://immigrationhistory.org/item/the-palmer-raids/)

### Targets and Methods

**Fact:** The raids particularly targeted Italian immigrants and Eastern European Jewish immigrants with alleged leftist ties, with focus on Italian anarchists and immigrant labor activists.

**Fact:** Radical labor unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and the Union of Russian Workers were primary targets. Anyone who was a member of the IWW was particularly at risk.

**Fact:** Arrests greatly exceeded the number of warrants obtained from courts. Many of those arrested were guilty of nothing more than having a foreign accent.

**Source:** [Britannica - Palmer Raids](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Palmer-Raids)

### Deportations and Resistance

**Fact:** Despite 6,000 arrests, only 556 foreign citizens were ultimately deported. Acting Secretary of Labor Louis Post reversed more than 70% of the 1,600 deportation warrants, objecting to Palmer's methods.

**Fact:** The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was founded in response to the Palmer Raids. On May 28, 1920, the ACLU published "Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice," documenting unlawful arrests, entrapment, and incommunicado detention. Legal scholars including Felix Frankfurter, Roscoe Pound, and Ernst Freund signed it.

**Source:** [FBI - Palmer Raids](https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/palmer-raids)

**Fact:** In June 1920, Massachusetts District Court Judge George W. Anderson ordered the discharge of 17 arrested aliens, writing that "a mob is a mob, whether made up of Government officials acting under instructions from the Department of Justice, or of criminals and loafers and the vicious classes." His decision effectively prevented renewal of the raids.

**Fact:** Palmer had predicted an armed Communist uprising on May 1, 1920. When it never materialized, his credibility collapsed and he was subject to "near-universal mockery."

**Source:** [Gilder Lehrman - Historical Context: The Post-World War I Red Scare](https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/teacher-resources/historical-context-post-world-war-i-red-scare)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** The First Red Scare demonstrates a pattern that would repeat throughout US history: using fear of foreign ideologies to suppress domestic labor organizing and leftist politics. The raids disproportionately targeted immigrant communities and labor unions rather than actual security threats. The founding of the ACLU in direct response to these abuses shows how civil liberties concerns emerged from this period.

## 3. Tulsa Race Massacre (1921)

### "Black Wall Street" - The Greenwood District

**Fact:** The Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma was home to most of the city's approximately 10,000 Black residents. It was sometimes referred to as "Black Wall Street."

**Fact:** Greenwood was likely the richest Black community in the United States. The district included several grocery stores, two newspapers, two movie theaters, nightclubs, numerous churches, and Black professionals including doctors, dentists, lawyers, and clergy.

**Source:** [Britannica - Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921](https://www.britannica.com/event/Tulsa-race-massacre-of-1921)

**Source:** [HISTORY - Tulsa Race Massacre](https://www.history.com/articles/tulsa-race-massacre)

### The Massacre

**Fact:** The massacre began on May 31, 1921, and lasted two days after Dick Rowland, a young Black shoe shiner, was accused of assaulting a white elevator operator named Sarah Page. An inflammatory report in the May 31 edition of the Tulsa Tribune spurred a confrontation.

**Fact:** A 2024 Department of Justice report found that the massacre "was the result not of uncontrolled mob violence, but of a coordinated, military-style attack on Greenwood."

**Source:** [Equal Justice Initiative - Justice Department Finds Tulsa Massacre Was Coordinated Attack](https://eji.org/news/justice-department-finds-tulsa-massacre-was-a-coordinated-military-style-attack/)

**Fact:** White rioters invaded Greenwood, killing residents and burning stores and homes. The Oklahoma National Guard imposed martial law around noon on June 1, ending the massacre.

### Death Toll and Destruction

**Fact:** The Oklahoma Bureau of Vital Statistics officially recorded 36 dead (10 white, 26 Black). However, experts now believe the actual death toll was between 100 and 300, possibly more.

**Fact:** The 2001 Oklahoma Commission report concluded that an accurate death toll may never be determined due to "the haphazard disposal of bodies in the Arkansas River, on flatbed rail cars, and in unmarked mass graves."

**Fact:** More than 1,400 homes and businesses were burned. Nearly 10,000 people were left homeless. Over 6,000 Black residents were held at the Convention Hall and the Fairgrounds, some for as long as eight days.

**Source:** [Oklahoma Historical Society - Tulsa Race Massacre](https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry?entry=TU013)

### Aftermath and Suppression

**Fact:** Greenwood residents filed over $1.8 million in damage claims (over $27 million in today's dollars). All but one claim was denied; only a white shop owner received compensation for guns taken from his shop.

**Fact:** The massacre was largely omitted from local, state, and national histories for decades. It was not until 1997 that Oklahoma authorized a commission to study the massacre.

**Fact:** Greenwood Rising, a history center honoring Black Wall Street and memorializing the victims, was established in 2021 by the Centennial Commission.

**Source:** [Museum of Tulsa History - 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre](https://tulsahistory.org/exhibit/1921-tulsa-race-massacre/)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** The Tulsa Race Massacre represents one of the most devastating acts of racial terrorism in US history. The coordinated destruction of Black wealth and the subsequent denial of insurance claims and reparations illustrates how systemic racism operated to prevent Black economic advancement. The decades-long suppression of this history from public memory demonstrates how historical narratives are actively shaped to obscure racial violence.

## 4. Immigration Act of 1924 (Johnson-Reed Act)

### Key Provisions

**Fact:** The Immigration Act of 1924 prevented immigration from Asia entirely and set quotas on immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. It also authorized the creation of the U.S. Border Patrol.

**Fact:** The act reduced annual immigration quotas from 3% of the 1910 foreign-born population (under the 1921 Emergency Quota Act) to 2% of the 1890 census count. The use of the 1890 census was deliberateâit predated the large wave of Southern and Eastern European immigration.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Immigration Act of 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924)

**Source:** [Migration Policy Institute - A Century Later](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/1924-us-immigration-act-history)

### Eugenics Influence

**Fact:** The quotas were inspired by American proponents of eugenics and were calculated to privilege "desirable" immigrants from Northern and Western Europe while limiting those considered less "racially desirable."

**Fact:** At the behest of a eugenics subcommittee chaired by eugenicist Madison Grant, Congress used the 1890 census specifically to increase Northern and Western European immigrants and decrease Southern and Eastern European immigrants.

**Fact:** Eugenics proponents, many of whom were respected academics and politicians, claimed that "Nordic" people from Northern Europe were genetically superior to the "Alpine" and "Mediterranean" races of Southern and Eastern Europe.

**Fact:** Harry Laughlin, eugenicist and expert advisor to the House Committee on Immigration, praised the 1924 act as a political breakthrough in adopting "scientific racism" as a foundation for immigration policy.

**Source:** [University of Missouri - Eugenics and Immigration](https://library.missouri.edu/specialcollections/exhibits/show/controlling-heredity/america/immigration)

### Impact on Jewish Immigration and the Holocaust

**Fact:** The law heavily restricted immigration from countries where most US Jews had originated. Russia alone had accounted for nearly 75% of Jewish immigrants. The use of the 1890 census made mass migration from Eastern Europe, where the vast majority of the Jewish diaspora lived, effectively impossible.

**Fact:** The law was not modified to aid the flight of Jewish refugees in the 1930s or 1940s despite the rise of Nazi Germany. As one historian noted, "The 1924 Act's inflexible rules prevented the rescue of countless individuals who would later perish in the Holocaust."

**Source:** [US Holocaust Memorial Museum - Immigration to the United States 1933-1941](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/immigration-to-the-united-states-1933-41)

### Connection to Nazi Germany

**Fact:** When Hitler published Mein Kampf in 1924, he held up the U.S. Immigration Restriction Act of 1924 as a model for his program of racial purification.

**Fact:** When the Nazis took power in 1933, they installed a eugenics program that consciously drew on the U.S. example. American eugenics influenced sterilization laws in dozens of states, which were studied and praised by German racial hygienists.

**Fact:** American eugenicists traveled to Germany to study the new Nazi laws, published scholarly articles praising the Nazi eugenics program, and received personal notes of thanks from Hitler for their books.

**Source:** [Oxford University Press - The Nazi Connection by Stefan Kuhl](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-nazi-connection-9780195149784)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** The Immigration Act of 1924 demonstrates how pseudoscientific racism was institutionalized in US law. The direct connection between American eugenics and Nazi Germany's racial policies is well-documented but rarely emphasized in standard US education. The act's role in preventing Jewish refugees from escaping the Holocaust represents one of its most tragic consequences.

## 5. The Great Depression (1929-1939)

### Causes

**Fact:** Multiple factors led to the Great Depression, including the U.S. stock market crash in October 1929 and the widespread failure of the American banking system.

**Fact:** During the 1920s, income levels varied widely and many Americans lived beyond their means. Credit was extended to many so they could purchase new inventions like washing machines, refrigerators, and automobiles.

**Fact:** Between 1929 and 1933, more than 100,000 businesses failed nationwide. When President Hoover left office in 1933, the national unemployment rate had reached nearly 25%.

**Source:** [FDR Presidential Library - Great Depression Facts](https://www.fdrlibrary.org/great-depression-facts)

### Hoovervilles

**Fact:** Hoovervilles were shanty towns built by the homeless during the Great Depression. They were deliberately named after Herbert Hoover, who was widely blamed for the economic crisis.

**Fact:** The term "Hooverville" was coined by Charles Michelson. There were hundreds of Hoovervilles across the country during the 1930s.

**Fact:** Seattle's Hooverville was one of the largest and longest-lasting, standing for ten years (1931-1941). It covered nine acres, housed up to 1,200 people, and had its own community government including an unofficial mayor.

**Source:** [HISTORY - Hoovervilles](https://www.history.com/articles/hoovervilles)

**Source:** [University of Washington - Hoovervilles and Homelessness](https://depts.washington.edu/depress/hooverville.shtml)

### Hoover's Response

**Fact:** President Hoover believed that self-reliance and self-help, not government intervention, were the best means to meet citizens' needs. He resisted direct government assistance throughout his presidency.

**Fact:** The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) was authorized to allot $1.5 billion to states for local public works projects, but Hoover severely limited the types of projects it could fund. There was no direct federal relief to individuals.

**Source:** [OpenStax - The Great Depression and President Hoover's Response](https://fscj.pressbooks.pub/modernushistory/chapter/brother-can-you-spare-a-dime-the-great-depression/)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** The naming of shantytowns after President Hoover reflects public recognition that government policy choicesânot just economic forcesâshaped the crisis. Hoover's ideological commitment to limited government intervention prolonged suffering and set the stage for the dramatic policy shifts of the New Deal.

## 6. The New Deal: Programs and Exclusions

### Major Programs

**Fact:** FDR declared a "banking holiday" to end bank runs and created new federal programs administered by "alphabet agencies":
- CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) - provided jobs to unemployed youths
- TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) - provided jobs and brought electricity to rural areas
- FERA (Federal Emergency Relief Administration) - provided emergency relief
- WPA (Works Progress Administration) - provided jobs to thousands of unemployed Americans

**Source:** [FDR Presidential Library - Great Depression Facts](https://www.fdrlibrary.org/great-depression-facts)

### Racial Exclusions

**Fact:** Neither agricultural laborers nor domestic servants were covered by Social Security old-age insurance. These categories included at least 60% of the nation's Black population.

**Fact:** As a result, 65% of African Americans throughout the country were ineligible for Social Security benefits, with an even higher percentage excluded in the South.

**Fact:** Agricultural and domestic workers were also excluded from the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which protected workers' rights to organizeâan effective way of excluding African Americans and Mexican Americans in the Southwest.

**Source:** [Social Security Administration - The Decision to Exclude Agricultural and Domestic Workers](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n4/v70n4p49.html)

**Source:** [Rockefeller Foundation - The New Deal Made America's Racial Inequality Worse](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/perspective/the-new-deal-made-americas-racial-inequality-worse-we-cant-make-the-same-mistake-with-covid-19-economic-crisis/)

### Charles Houston's Critique

**Fact:** Charles Hamilton Houston, Howard University professor and NAACP lawyer, described the National Labor Relations Act as "a sieve with the holes just big enough for the majority of Negroes to fall through."

**Fact:** In February 1935, Houston testified before the House Committee on Labor, arguing that labor organizing should extend to "domestic service, agriculture, and everything else."

**Source:** [SOAR Works - Charles H. Houston and the New Deal Exclusion](https://soarworks.samhsa.gov/article/charles-h-houston-and-the-new-deal-exclusion)

### The Debate Over Motivations

**Fact:** One historical interpretation argues that Roosevelt intentionally excluded occupations dominated by people of color to win support from Southern Democrats, whose political economy depended on the economic dependence of mostly Black agricultural labor.

**Fact:** A competing interpretation notes that essentially all committee membersâof both parties and all regionsâvoted for the exclusions, suggesting administrative challenges with payroll tax collection rather than purely racial motivations.

**Fact:** Regardless of motivation, the exemptions were not repealed until the 1950s. The 15+ year exclusion of African American workers worsened the economic gap between Black and white citizens.

**Source:** [Living New Deal - The New Deal and Race](https://livingnewdeal.org/new-deal-and-race/)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** The New Deal represents a fundamental tension in American reform: programs that expanded the social safety net for many Americans simultaneously reinforced racial hierarchies by excluding the occupations where Black and brown workers were concentrated. Whether these exclusions resulted from Southern Democratic pressure or administrative convenience, the racial impact was the same. Charles Houston's critique demonstrates that Black leaders recognized and opposed these exclusions at the time.

## 7. Japanese American Internment (1942-1945)

### Executive Order 9066

**Fact:** Executive Order 9066 was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942. The order authorized the forced removal of all persons deemed a threat to national security from the West Coast.

**Fact:** The order led to the incarceration of approximately 120,000-125,000 Japanese Americans. Two-thirds of those displaced (approximately 80,000) were U.S. citizens.

**Source:** [National Archives - Executive Order 9066](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/executive-order-9066)

**Source:** [FDR Presidential Library - Executive Order 9066](https://www.fdrlibrary.org/executive-order-9066)

### Implementation

**Fact:** On March 29, 1942, Public Proclamation No. 4 began forced evacuation on 48-hour notice.

**Fact:** In six months, approximately 122,000 men, women, and children were first moved to "assembly centers," then to 10 isolated, fenced, and guarded "relocation centers" in six western states and Arkansas: Heart Mountain (Wyoming), Tule Lake and Manzanar (California), Topaz (Utah), Poston and Gila River (Arizona), Granada (Colorado), Minidoka (Idaho), and Jerome and Rohwer (Arkansas).

**Source:** [National WWII Museum - Japanese American Incarceration](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/japanese-american-incarceration)

### Civil Liberties Violations

**Fact:** In the Korematsu v. United States case, Justice Frank Murphy wrote in dissent that the internment was "another example of the unconstitutional resort to racism inherent in the entire evacuation program" and "bears no reasonable relation to military necessity and is utterly foreign to the ideals and traditions of the American people."

**Source:** [Britannica - Executive Order 9066](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Executive-Order-9066)

### Economic Impact

**Fact:** The speed of evacuation forced many homeowners and businessmen to sell quickly. Total property loss is estimated at $1.3 billion, and net income loss at $2.7 billion (calculated in 1983 dollars).

**Source:** [Immigration History - Executive Order 9066](https://immigrationhistory.org/item/executive-order-9066/)

### Redress

**Fact:** On February 19, 1976, President Gerald Ford signed a proclamation formally terminating Executive Order 9066 and apologizing for the internment.

**Fact:** In 1988, Public Law 100-383 (Civil Liberties Act) acknowledged the injustice, apologized, and authorized $20,000 cash payments to each person who was incarcerated.

**Fact:** February 19 is now the Day of Remembrance, an annual commemoration of the unjust incarceration.

**Source:** [National Archives - Japanese-American Incarceration During World War II](https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/japanese-relocation)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** Japanese American internment represents the largest mass incarceration of civilians in US history based solely on ethnicity. Despite no evidence of disloyalty, Japanese Americans lost their liberty, property, and livelihoods. The 40+ year delay before official apology and the modest $20,000 reparations demonstrate how slowly the US government acknowledges its constitutional violations against minority communities.

## 8. World War II: Segregation, Profits, and Strategy

### The Segregated Military

**Fact:** About 1.2 million African American men served in World War II while being treated as second-class citizens. The U.S. Army was racially segregated throughout the war.

**Fact:** In 1939, only 3,640 Black soldiers were enlisted, under white leadership. At all bases, there were separate blood banks, hospitals or wards, medical staff, barracks, and recreational facilities for Black soldiers.

**Source:** [HISTORY - Black Americans Who Served in WWII Faced Segregation](https://www.history.com/articles/black-soldiers-world-war-ii-discrimination)

**Source:** [National WWII Museum - African Americans Fought for Freedom](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/african-americans-fought-freedom-home-and-abroad-during-world-war-ii)

### The Double V Campaign

**Fact:** In 1942, the Pittsburgh Courier, a Black newspaper, launched the "Double V Campaign" in response to a letter from a 26-year-old Black soldier. The slogan stood for victory for democracy overseas and victory against racism in America.

**Source:** [PBS - What Was Black America's Double War?](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/what-was-black-americas-double-war/)

### Discrimination in Defense Industry

**Fact:** Southern Congressmen and Senators secured lucrative defense contracts, but local Jim Crow laws on segregating the workplace remained in effect.

**Fact:** Industry leaders often refused to comply with Executive Order 8802 (which prohibited ethnic and racial discrimination in defense industries), arguing that hiring African Americans would force workforce integration. The St. Louis Ordnance Plant deliberately ignored War Department hiring policies and created a segregated production line when forced to hire Black workers.

**Source:** [National Archives - Victory at Home and Abroad: Combating Segregation](https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2021/02/18/victory-at-home-and-abroad-combating-segregation-in-the-armed-forces/)

### Post-War Discrimination

**Fact:** After WWII ended, Black soldiers returned home to violent white mobs. In addition to racial violence, Black soldiers were often denied benefits guaranteed under the G.I. Bill, including tuition assistance, job placement, and home and business loans.

**Fact:** President Harry S. Truman integrated the Armed Forces in 1948 with Executive Order 9981. The last all-Black unit was disbanded in 1954.

**Source:** [HISTORY - Black Americans Who Served in WWII](https://www.history.com/articles/black-soldiers-world-war-ii-discrimination)

### The Second Front Controversy

**Fact:** Soviet Premier Stalin demanded a Western European invasion ("second front") starting in 1942, arguing it would spare many of the millions who died on the Eastern Front.

**Fact:** Churchill and Roosevelt argued that any attempt to land troops in Western Europe would result in heavy casualties. The 1942 Dieppe raid showed German preparedness to defend French ports.

**Fact:** Stalin saw the delays as proof that the US and Britain wanted the Soviet Union to bear the brunt of the fighting. Some Russian officials believed Britain and America waited until Germany was weaker.

**Source:** [History Today - The Road to D-Day](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/road-d-day)

**Source:** [Spartacus Educational - Second Front](https://spartacus-educational.com/RUSsecond.htm)

**Fact:** At the Tehran Conference in November 1943, Roosevelt allied himself with Stalin to insist on a French invasion. Churchill resisted but was overruled. D-Day was set for May 1944, later delayed to June due to expanded invasion plans and weather.

**Source:** [People's World - Let's Not Leave the Soviet Union Out of Our D-Day History](https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/lets-not-leave-the-soviet-union-out-of-our-d-day-history/)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** WWII reveals sharp contradictions in American democracy: fighting fascism abroad while maintaining racial segregation at home. The Double V Campaign articulated what Black Americans understoodâthat the war against Nazi racism required a corresponding war against American racism. The second front controversy also reveals tensions within the Allied coalition and questions about whether strategic delays were influenced by a desire to weaken the Soviet Union.

## 9. The Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

### The Bombings

**Fact:** The United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.

**Fact:** Over the following two to four months, the bombs killed 90,000 to 166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000 to 80,000 in Nagasaki, with roughly half the deaths occurring on the first day.

**Fact:** Despite Hiroshima's military garrison of approximately 24,000 troops, about 90% of the dead were civilians.

**Source:** [Wikipedia - Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki)

### The "Traditionalist" Justification

**Fact:** President Truman claimed on August 9, 1945, that Hiroshima was "a military base" and that "we wished in this first attack to avoid, insofar as possible, the killing of civilians."

**Fact:** Secretary of War Henry Stimson wrote that by July 1945 there was no sign of "any weakening in the Japanese determination to fight" and estimated that invasion operations "might be expected to cost over a million casualties, to American forces alone."

**Source:** [National Park Service - Harry Truman's Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb](https://www.nps.gov/articles/trumanatomicbomb.htm)

### The "Revisionist" Critique

**Fact:** Historian Sam Walker calls the atomic bomb debate "in terms of longevity and in terms of bitterness, the most controversial issue in American history."

**Fact:** Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Truman, stated in 1950: "The use of [the atomic bombs] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons."

**Fact:** Major General Curtis LeMay stated in September 1945 that "The atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all."

### The Question of Civilian Targeting

**Fact:** Archival records indicate that killing civilians was a primary purpose of the Hiroshima bombing. Historians note the prioritization of maximizing the bomb's psychological impact on the Japanese population.

**Fact:** Philosopher Michael Walzer describes the bombings as "war terrorism: the effort to kill civilians in such large numbers that their government is forced to surrender. Hiroshima seems to me the classic case."

**Source:** [Lawfare - Hiroshima and the Myths of Military Targets and Unconditional Surrender](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/hiroshima-and-myths-military-targets-and-unconditional-surrender)

### The Soviet Factor

**Fact:** Historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa argues that the Soviet declaration of war on Japan (August 8, 1945) was a greater influence on Japanese surrender than the atomic bombings.

**Fact:** Some historians argue the atomic bomb was a strong message for the Soviets. In this reading, "Hiroshima and Nagasaki may have been the first shots of the Cold War as well as the final shots of World War II."

**Source:** [Association for Asian Studies - Learning from Truman's Decision](https://www.asianstudies.org/publications/eaa/archives/learning-from-trumans-decision-the-atomic-bomb-and-japans-surrender/)

### Legal Questions

**Fact:** Critics argue that "The use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was illegal in the light of the principles and rules of International Humanitarian Law" because the bombings "made civilians the object of attack, using nuclear weapons that were incapable of distinguishing between civilians and military targets."

**Source:** [Columbia University - The Atomic Bomb](https://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/japan_1900_bomb.htm)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** The atomic bomb debate reveals how historical narratives serve political purposes. The "million lives saved" figure became canonical despite being contested by military leaders at the time. The possibility that the bombs targeted civilians deliberately to demonstrate powerâboth to Japan and the Soviet Unionâchallenges the humanitarian justification. The timing of the Soviet entry into the Pacific war adds complexity to claims that the bombs were necessary for Japanese surrender.

## 10. Post-WWII Order: US as Empire

### The Bretton Woods System (1944)

**Fact:** The Bretton Woods Conference was held July 1-22, 1944, in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, with delegates from 44 nations agreeing on rules for the post-WWII international monetary system.

**Fact:** The conference created the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank).

**Fact:** The system pegged the U.S. dollar to gold at $35 per ounce, positioning the dollar as the world's reserve currency. Other nations pegged their currencies to the dollar.

**Source:** [Library of Congress - Bretton Woods Conference](https://guides.loc.gov/this-month-in-business-history/july/bretton-woods-conference)

### US Economic Hegemony

**Fact:** The United States controlled two-thirds of the world's gold and insisted that the Bretton Woods system rest on both gold and the US dollar.

**Fact:** The system gave the US what was later termed an "exorbitant privilege"âthe ability to run budget deficits without facing the same constraints as other countries, since it could pay for goods, services, and debts in its own currency.

**Fact:** The IMF and World Bank became instruments through which the United States could exert influence without direct intervention.

**Source:** [Stratheia - The Connection Between Bretton Woods and US Hegemony](https://stratheia.com/the-connection-between-bretton-woods-and-us-hegemony/)

**Fact:** The rise of the postwar US as the world's leading industrial, monetary, and military power was rooted in the fact that the mainland US was untouched by the war, while Soviet and European economies were devastated.

**Source:** [CGPI - 75 Years of the Bretton Woods System](https://cgpi.org/8297)

### NATO Formation (1949)

**Fact:** NATO was established April 4, 1949, by 12 founding members: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

**Fact:** NATO was the first peacetime military alliance the United States entered outside the Western Hemisphere. The signing marked "a fundamental transformation in US foreign and defense policy."

**Source:** [U.S. Department of State - North Atlantic Treaty Organization](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/nato)

**Fact:** The first NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, stated in 1949 that the organization's goal was "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."

**Source:** [Wikipedia - NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO)

**Fact:** The United States stationed materiel and tens of thousands of troops across Europe. In 1949, the Mutual Defense Assistance Program appropriated $1.4 billion for building Western European defenses.

**Fact:** All Supreme Allied Commanders Europe (SACEUR) have been from the United States Armed Forces.

**Source:** [HISTORY - Formation of NATO](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/formation-of-nato-and-warsaw-pact)

### The Cold War Framework

**Fact:** The Soviet Union and its Communist allies formed the Warsaw Pact in 1955. The alignment of nearly every European nation into one of two opposing camps formalized the political division of Europe.

**Fact:** Four new NATO members joined during the Cold War: Greece (1952), Turkey (1952), West Germany (1955), and Spain (1982).

**Source:** [Britannica - NATO](https://www.britannica.com/topic/North-Atlantic-Treaty-Organization)

### End of Bretton Woods, Continuation of Hegemony

**Fact:** The fixed exchange rate system ended after August 1971, when President Nixon suspended the dollar's convertibility into gold.

**Fact:** Despite the system's collapse, its influence remains evident in the continued dominance of the dollar and the global financial institutions that originated from Bretton Woods.

**Source:** [American University - The Importance of Bretton Woods, 80 Years Later](https://www.american.edu/sis/news/20240722-the-importance-of-bretton-woods-80-years-later.cfm)

> [!analysis]
> **Analysis:** The post-WWII institutions created a framework for American global hegemony that persists today. The US emerged from WWII as the only major power with its industrial base intact, allowing it to set the rules of the international economic and military order. The IMF, World Bank, and NATO all reflected American interests while being presented as multilateral institutions. Understanding this period is essential for comprehending contemporary US foreign policy and global economic structures.

## Key Themes and Patterns

### Economic Motivations Behind War
- WWI entry tied to protecting Wall Street investments and war profits

- Post-war institutions (IMF, World Bank) served US economic interests

### Suppression of Domestic Dissent
- Palmer Raids targeted labor organizers and immigrants
- CPI propaganda manufactured consent for war
- Pattern: foreign threats used to justify domestic repression

### Racial Violence and Exclusion
- Tulsa Massacre destroyed Black wealth with impunity
- Immigration Act of 1924 codified eugenic racism
- New Deal exclusions reinforced economic inequality
- Japanese internment violated constitutional rights
- Military segregation persisted through WWII

### Manufacturing Historical Narratives
- Tulsa Massacre suppressed from history for decades
- Atomic bomb debate shaped by Cold War concerns
- US role as "arsenal of democracy" emphasized over domestic contradictions
